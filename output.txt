RAHUL IS A POPULAR MALE NAME IN INDIA AND HAS A VARIETY OF MEANINGS. THE EARLIEST MEANING FOUND IN THE UPANISHADS IS 
"CONQUEROR OF ALL MISERIES. LATER USE OF THE WORD IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE BUDDHA, WHO NAMED HIS SON RAHULA AS HE FELT THAT 
FAMILY TIES COULD BE AN OBSTACLE IN THE PATH TO RENUNCIATION AND NIRVANA. BUDDHA UTTERED RAHUL WHEN HE FIRST SAW HIS SON AND GAVE A NEW MEANING "RELATIONSHIP" AND "BONDAGE" TO THIS NAME.[2] RAHUL MEANS MOON, ABLE/EFFICIENT IN SANSKRIT AND PALI. RAHUL ALSO MEANS "TRAVELER" IN ARABIC.
BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY IS AN ADVANCED DATABASE MECHANISM THAT ALLOWS TRANSPARENT INFORMATION SHARING WITHIN A BUSINESS 
NETWORK. A BLOCKCHAIN DATABASE STORES DATA IN BLOCKS THAT ARE LINKED TOGETHER IN A CHAIN. THE DATA IS CHRONOLOGICALLY 
CONSISTENT BECAUSE YOU CANNOT DELETE OR MODIFY THE CHAIN WITHOUT CONSENSUS FROM THE NETWORK. AS A RESULT, YOU CAN USE
 BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE AN UNALTERABLE OR IMMUTABLE LEDGER FOR TRACKING ORDERS, PAYMENTS, ACCOUNTS, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS. THE SYSTEM HAS BUILT-IN MECHANISMS THAT PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTION ENTRIES AND CREATE CONSISTENCY IN THE SHARED VIEW OF THESE TRANSACTIONS.
TRADITIONAL DATABASE TECHNOLOGIES PRESENT SEVERAL CHALLENGES FOR RECORDING FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS. FOR INSTANCE, CONSIDER THE SALE OF A PROPERTY. ONCE THE MONEY IS EXCHANGED, OWNERSHIP OF THE PROPERTY IS TRANSFERRED TO THE BUYER. INDIVIDUALLY, BOTH THE BUYER AND THE SELLER CAN RECORD THE MONETARY TRANSACTIONS, BUT NEITHER SOURCE CAN BE TRUSTED. THE SELLER CAN EASILY CLAIM THEY HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE MONEY EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE, AND THE BUYER CAN EQUALLY ARGUE THAT THEY HAVE PAID THE MONEY EVEN IF THEY HAVEN’T.

TO AVOID POTENTIAL LEGAL ISSUES, A TRUSTED THIRD PARTY HAS TO SUPERVISE AND VALIDATE TRANSACTIONS. THE PRESENCE OF THIS CENTRAL AUTHORITY NOT ONLY COMPLICATES THE TRANSACTION BUT ALSO CREATES A SINGLE POINT OF VULNERABILITY. IF THE CENTRAL DATABASE WAS COMPROMISED, BOTH PARTIES COULD SUFFER.

BLOCKCHAIN MITIGATES SUCH ISSUES BY CREATING A DECENTRALIZED, TAMPER-PROOF SYSTEM TO RECORD TRANSACTIONS. IN THE PROPERTY TRANSACTION SCENARIO, BLOCKCHAIN CREATES ONE LEDGER EACH FOR THE BUYER AND THE SELLER. ALL TRANSACTIONS MUST BE APPROVED BY BOTH PARTIES AND ARE AUTOMATICALLY UPDATED IN BOTH OF THEIR LEDGERS IN REAL TIME. ANY CORRUPTION IN HISTORICAL TRANSACTIONS WILL CORRUPT THE ENTIRE LEDGER. THESE PROPERTIES OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY HAVE LED TO ITS USE IN VARIOUS SECTORS, INCLUDING THE CREATION OF DIGITAL CURRENCY LIKE BITCOIN.
HOW DO DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES USE BLOCKCHAIN?
BLOCKCHAIN IS AN EMERGING TECHNOLOGY THAT IS BEING ADOPTED IN INNOVATIVE MANNER BY VARIOUS INDUSTRIES. WE DESCRIBE SOME USE CASES IN DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES IN THE FOLLOWING SUBSECTIONS:


ENERGY
ENERGY COMPANIES USE BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE PEER-TO-PEER ENERGY TRADING PLATFORMS AND STREAMLINE ACCESS TO RENEWABLE ENERGY. FOR EXAMPLE, CONSIDER THESE USES:

BLOCKCHAIN-BASED ENERGY COMPANIES HAVE CREATED A TRADING PLATFORM FOR THE SALE OF ELECTRICITY BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS. HOMEOWNERS WITH SOLAR PANELS USE THIS PLATFORM TO SELL THEIR EXCESS SOLAR ENERGY TO NEIGHBORS. THE PROCESS IS LARGELY AUTOMATED: SMART METERS CREATE TRANSACTIONS, AND BLOCKCHAIN RECORDS THEM.
WITH BLOCKCHAIN-BASED CROWD FUNDING INITIATIVES, USERS CAN SPONSOR AND OWN SOLAR PANELS IN COMMUNITIES THAT LACK ENERGY ACCESS. SPONSORS MIGHT ALSO RECEIVE RENT FOR THESE COMMUNITIES ONCE THE SOLAR PANELS ARE CONSTRUCTED.
FINANCE
TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL SYSTEMS, LIKE BANKS AND STOCK EXCHANGES, USE BLOCKCHAIN SERVICES TO MANAGE ONLINE PAYMENTS, ACCOUNTS, AND MARKET TRADING. FOR EXAMPLE, SINGAPORE EXCHANGE LIMITED, AN INVESTMENT HOLDING COMPANY THAT PROVIDES FINANCIAL TRADING SERVICES THROUGHOUT ASIA, USES BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY TO BUILD A MORE EFFICIENT INTERBANK PAYMENT ACCOUNT. BY ADOPTING BLOCKCHAIN, THEY SOLVED SEVERAL CHALLENGES, INCLUDING BATCH PROCESSING AND MANUAL RECONCILIATION OF SEVERAL THOUSAND FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS.

MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT
COMPANIES IN MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT USE BLOCKCHAIN SYSTEMS TO MANAGE COPYRIGHT DATA. COPYRIGHT VERIFICATION IS CRITICAL FOR THE FAIR COMPENSATION OF ARTISTS. IT TAKES MULTIPLE TRANSACTIONS TO RECORD THE SALE OR TRANSFER OF COPYRIGHT CONTENT. SONY MUSIC ENTERTAINMENT JAPAN USES BLOCKCHAIN SERVICES TO MAKE DIGITAL RIGHTS MANAGEMENT MORE EFFICIENT. THEY HAVE SUCCESSFULLY USED BLOCKCHAIN STRATEGY TO IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY AND REDUCE COSTS IN COPYRIGHT PROCESSING.

RETAIL
RETAIL COMPANIES USE BLOCKCHAIN TO TRACK THE MOVEMENT OF GOODS BETWEEN SUPPLIERS AND BUYERS. FOR EXAMPLE, AMAZON RETAIL HAS FILED A PATENT FOR A DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM THAT WILL USE BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY TO VERIFY THAT ALL GOODS SOLD ON THE PLATFORM ARE AUTHENTIC. AMAZON SELLERS CAN MAP THEIR GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS BY ALLOWING PARTICIPANTS SUCH AS MANUFACTURERS, COURIERS, DISTRIBUTORS, END USERS, AND SECONDARY USERS TO ADD EVENTS TO THE LEDGER AFTER REGISTERING WITH A CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY. 

WHAT ARE THE FEATURES OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY?
BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY HAS THE FOLLOWING MAIN FEATURES:

DECENTRALIZATION
DECENTRALIZATION IN BLOCKCHAIN REFERS TO TRANSFERRING CONTROL AND DECISION MAKING FROM A CENTRALIZED ENTITY (INDIVIDUAL, ORGANIZATION, OR GROUP) TO A DISTRIBUTED NETWORK. DECENTRALIZED BLOCKCHAIN NETWORKS USE TRANSPARENCY TO REDUCE THE NEED FOR TRUST AMONG PARTICIPANTS. THESE NETWORKS ALSO DETER PARTICIPANTS FROM EXERTING AUTHORITY OR CONTROL OVER ONE ANOTHER IN WAYS THAT DEGRADE THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE NETWORK.

IMMUTABILITY
IMMUTABILITY MEANS SOMETHING CANNOT BE CHANGED OR ALTERED. NO PARTICIPANT CAN TAMPER WITH A TRANSACTION ONCE SOMEONE HAS RECORDED IT TO THE SHARED LEDGER. IF A TRANSACTION RECORD INCLUDES AN ERROR, YOU MUST ADD A NEW TRANSACTION TO REVERSE THE MISTAKE, AND BOTH TRANSACTIONS ARE VISIBLE TO THE NETWORK.

CONSENSUS
A BLOCKCHAIN SYSTEM ESTABLISHES RULES ABOUT PARTICIPANT CONSENT FOR RECORDING TRANSACTIONS. YOU CAN RECORD NEW TRANSACTIONS ONLY WHEN THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE NETWORK GIVE THEIR CONSENT.

WHAT ARE THE KEY COMPONENTS OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY?
BLOCKCHAIN ARCHITECTURE HAS THE FOLLOWING MAIN COMPONENTS:

A DISTRIBUTED LEDGER

A DISTRIBUTED LEDGER IS THE SHARED DATABASE IN THE BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK THAT STORES THE TRANSACTIONS, SUCH AS A SHARED FILE THAT EVERYONE IN THE TEAM CAN EDIT. IN MOST SHARED TEXT EDITORS, ANYONE WITH EDITING RIGHTS CAN DELETE THE ENTIRE FILE. HOWEVER, DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGIES HAVE STRICT RULES ABOUT WHO CAN EDIT AND HOW TO EDIT. YOU CANNOT DELETE ENTRIES ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN RECORDED.

SMART CONTRACTS
COMPANIES USE SMART CONTRACTS TO SELF-MANAGE BUSINESS CONTRACTS WITHOUT THE NEED FOR AN ASSISTING THIRD PARTY. THEY ARE PROGRAMS STORED ON THE BLOCKCHAIN SYSTEM THAT RUN AUTOMATICALLY WHEN PREDETERMINED CONDITIONS ARE MET. THEY RUN IF-THEN CHECKS SO THAT TRANSACTIONS CAN BE COMPLETED CONFIDENTLY. FOR EXAMPLE, A LOGISTICS COMPANY CAN HAVE A SMART CONTRACT THAT AUTOMATICALLY MAKES PAYMENT ONCE GOODS HAVE ARRIVED AT THE PORT.

PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY
PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY IS A SECURITY FEATURE TO UNIQUELY IDENTIFY PARTICIPANTS IN THE BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK. THIS MECHANISM GENERATES TWO SETS OF KEYS FOR NETWORK MEMBERS. ONE KEY IS A PUBLIC KEY THAT IS COMMON TO EVERYONE IN THE NETWORK. THE OTHER IS A PRIVATE KEY THAT IS UNIQUE TO EVERY MEMBER. THE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC KEYS WORK TOGETHER TO UNLOCK THE DATA IN THE LEDGER. 

FOR EXAMPLE, JOHN AND JILL ARE TWO MEMBERS OF THE NETWORK. JOHN RECORDS A TRANSACTION THAT IS ENCRYPTED WITH HIS PRIVATE KEY. JILL CAN DECRYPT IT WITH HER PUBLIC KEY. THIS WAY, JILL IS CONFIDENT THAT JOHN MADE THE TRANSACTION. JILL'S PUBLIC KEY WOULDN'T HAVE WORKED IF JOHN'S PRIVATE KEY HAD BEEN TAMPERED WITH.

HOW DOES BLOCKCHAIN WORK?
WHILE UNDERLYING BLOCKCHAIN MECHANISMS ARE COMPLEX, WE GIVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW IN THE FOLLOWING STEPS. BLOCKCHAIN SOFTWARE CAN AUTOMATE MOST OF THESE STEPS:

STEP 1 – RECORD THE TRANSACTION
A BLOCKCHAIN TRANSACTION SHOWS THE MOVEMENT OF PHYSICAL OR DIGITAL ASSETS FROM ONE PARTY TO ANOTHER IN THE BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK. IT IS RECORDED AS A DATA BLOCK AND CAN INCLUDE DETAILS LIKE THESE:

WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THE TRANSACTION?
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE TRANSACTION?
WHEN DID THE TRANSACTION OCCUR?
WHERE DID THE TRANSACTION OCCUR?
WHY DID THE TRANSACTION OCCUR?
HOW MUCH OF THE ASSET WAS EXCHANGED?
HOW MANY PRE-CONDITIONS WERE MET DURING THE TRANSACTION?
STEP 2 – GAIN CONSENSUS

PARAGRAPHS
WHAT THIS HANDOUT IS ABOUT
THIS HANDOUT WILL HELP YOU UNDERSTAND HOW PARAGRAPHS ARE FORMED, HOW TO DEVELOP STRONGER PARAGRAPHS, AND HOW TO COMPLETELY AND CLEARLY EXPRESS YOUR IDEAS.

WHAT IS A PARAGRAPH?
PARAGRAPHS ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF PAPERS. MANY STUDENTS DEFINE PARAGRAPHS IN TERMS OF LENGTH: A PARAGRAPH IS A GROUP OF AT LEAST FIVE SENTENCES, A PARAGRAPH IS HALF A PAGE LONG, ETC. IN REALITY, THOUGH, THE UNITY AND COHERENCE OF IDEAS AMONG SENTENCES IS WHAT CONSTITUTES A PARAGRAPH. A PARAGRAPH IS DEFINED AS “A GROUP OF SENTENCES OR A SINGLE SENTENCE THAT FORMS A UNIT” (LUNSFORD AND CONNORS 116). LENGTH AND APPEARANCE DO NOT DETERMINE WHETHER A SECTION IN A PAPER IS A PARAGRAPH. FOR INSTANCE, IN SOME STYLES OF WRITING, PARTICULARLY JOURNALISTIC STYLES, A PARAGRAPH CAN BE JUST ONE SENTENCE LONG. ULTIMATELY, A PARAGRAPH IS A SENTENCE OR GROUP OF SENTENCES THAT SUPPORT ONE MAIN IDEA. IN THIS HANDOUT, WE WILL REFER TO THIS AS THE “CONTROLLING IDEA,” BECAUSE IT CONTROLS WHAT HAPPENS IN THE REST OF THE PARAGRAPH.
HOW DO I DECIDE WHAT TO PUT IN A PARAGRAPH?
BEFORE YOU CAN BEGIN TO DETERMINE WHAT THE COMPOSITION OF A PARTICULAR PARAGRAPH WILL BE, YOU MUST FIRST DECIDE ON AN ARGUMENT AND A WORKING THESIS STATEMENT FOR YOUR PAPER. WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT IDEA THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO CONVEY TO YOUR READER? THE INFORMATION IN EACH PARAGRAPH MUST BE RELATED TO THAT IDEA. IN OTHER WORDS, YOUR PARAGRAPHS SHOULD REMIND YOUR READER THAT THERE IS A RECURRENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOUR THESIS AND THE INFORMATION IN EACH PARAGRAPH. A WORKING THESIS FUNCTIONS LIKE A SEED FROM WHICH YOUR PAPER, AND YOUR IDEAS, WILL GROW. THE WHOLE PROCESS IS AN ORGANIC ONE—A NATURAL PROGRESSION FROM A SEED TO A FULL-BLOWN PAPER WHERE THERE ARE DIRECT, FAMILIAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ALL OF THE IDEAS IN THE PAPER.

THE DECISION ABOUT WHAT TO PUT INTO YOUR PARAGRAPHS BEGINS WITH THE GERMINATION OF A SEED OF IDEAS; THIS “GERMINATION PROCESS” IS BETTER KNOWN AS BRAINSTORMING. THERE ARE MANY TECHNIQUES FOR BRAINSTORMING; WHICHEVER ONE YOU CHOOSE, THIS STAGE OF PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT CANNOT BE SKIPPED. BUILDING PARAGRAPHS CAN BE LIKE BUILDING A SKYSCRAPER: THERE MUST BE A WELL-PLANNED FOUNDATION THAT SUPPORTS WHAT YOU ARE BUILDING. ANY CRACKS, INCONSISTENCIES, OR OTHER CORRUPTIONS OF THE FOUNDATION CAN CAUSE YOUR WHOLE PAPER TO CRUMBLE.

SO, LET’S SUPPOSE THAT YOU HAVE DONE SOME BRAINSTORMING TO DEVELOP YOUR THESIS. WHAT ELSE SHOULD YOU KEEP IN MIND AS YOU BEGIN TO CREATE PARAGRAPHS? EVERY PARAGRAPH IN A PAPER SHOULD BE:

UNIFIED: ALL OF THE SENTENCES IN A SINGLE PARAGRAPH SHOULD BE RELATED TO A SINGLE CONTROLLING IDEA (OFTEN EXPRESSED IN THE TOPIC SENTENCE OF THE PARAGRAPH).
CLEARLY RELATED TO THE THESIS: THE SENTENCES SHOULD ALL REFER TO THE CENTRAL IDEA, OR THESIS, OF THE PAPER (ROSEN AND BEHRENS 119).
COHERENT: THE SENTENCES SHOULD BE ARRANGED IN A LOGICAL MANNER AND SHOULD FOLLOW A DEFINITE PLAN FOR DEVELOPMENT (ROSEN AND BEHRENS 119).
WELL-DEVELOPED: EVERY IDEA DISCUSSED IN THE PARAGRAPH SHOULD BE ADEQUATELY EXPLAINED AND SUPPORTED THROUGH EVIDENCE AND DETAILS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO EXPLAIN THE PARAGRAPH’S CONTROLLING IDEA (ROSEN AND BEHRENS 119).
HOW DO I ORGANIZE A PARAGRAPH?
THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS TO ORGANIZE A PARAGRAPH. THE ORGANIZATION YOU CHOOSE WILL DEPEND ON THE CONTROLLING IDEA OF THE PARAGRAPH. BELOW ARE A FEW POSSIBILITIES FOR ORGANIZATION, WITH LINKS TO BRIEF EXAMPLES:

NARRATION: TELL A STORY. GO CHRONOLOGICALLY, FROM START TO FINISH. (SEE AN EXAMPLE.)
DESCRIPTION: PROVIDE SPECIFIC DETAILS ABOUT WHAT SOMETHING LOOKS, SMELLS, TASTES, SOUNDS, OR FEELS LIKE. ORGANIZE SPATIALLY, IN ORDER OF APPEARANCE, OR BY TOPIC. (SEE AN EXAMPLE.)
PROCESS: EXPLAIN HOW SOMETHING WORKS, STEP BY STEP. PERHAPS FOLLOW A SEQUENCE—FIRST, SECOND, THIRD. (SEE AN EXAMPLE.)
CLASSIFICATION: SEPARATE INTO GROUPS OR EXPLAIN THE VARIOUS PARTS OF A TOPIC. (SEE AN EXAMPLE.)
ILLUSTRATION: GIVE EXAMPLES AND EXPLAIN HOW THOSE EXAMPLES SUPPORT YOUR POINT. (SEE AN EXAMPLE IN THE 5-STEP PROCESS BELOW.)
ILLUSTRATION PARAGRAPH: A 5-STEP EXAMPLE
FROM THE LIST ABOVE, LET’S CHOOSE “ILLUSTRATION” AS OUR RHETORICAL PURPOSE. WE’LL WALK THROUGH A 5-STEP PROCESS FOR BUILDING A PARAGRAPH THAT ILLUSTRATES A POINT IN AN ARGUMENT. FOR EACH STEP THERE IS AN EXPLANATION AND EXAMPLE. OUR EXAMPLE PARAGRAPH WILL BE ABOUT HUMAN MISCONCEPTIONS OF PIRANHAS.

STEP 1. DECIDE ON A CONTROLLING IDEA AND CREATE A TOPIC SENTENCE
PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT BEGINS WITH THE FORMULATION OF THE CONTROLLING IDEA. THIS IDEA DIRECTS THE PARAGRAPH’S DEVELOPMENT. OFTEN, THE CONTROLLING IDEA OF A PARAGRAPH WILL APPEAR IN THE FORM OF A TOPIC SENTENCE. IN SOME CASES, YOU MAY NEED MORE THAN ONE SENTENCE TO EXPRESS A PARAGRAPH’S CONTROLLING IDEA.

CONTROLLING IDEA AND TOPIC SENTENCE — DESPITE THE FACT THAT PIRANHAS ARE RELATIVELY HARMLESS, MANY PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THE PERVASIVE MYTH THAT PIRANHAS ARE DANGEROUS TO HUMANS.

STEP 2. ELABORATE ON THE CONTROLLING IDEA
PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT CONTINUES WITH AN ELABORATION ON THE CONTROLLING IDEA, PERHAPS WITH AN EXPLANATION, IMPLICATION, OR STATEMENT ABOUT SIGNIFICANCE. OUR EXAMPLE OFFERS A POSSIBLE EXPLANATION FOR THE PERVASIVENESS OF THE MYTH.

ELABORATION — THIS IMPRESSION OF PIRANHAS IS EXACERBATED BY THEIR MISCHARACTERIZATION IN POPULAR MEDIA.

STEP 3. GIVE AN EXAMPLE (OR MULTIPLE EXAMPLES)
PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT PROGRESSES WITH AN EXAMPLE (OR MORE) THAT ILLUSTRATES THE CLAIMS MADE IN THE PREVIOUS SENTENCES.

EXAMPLE — FOR EXAMPLE, THE PROMOTIONAL POSTER FOR THE 1978 HORROR FILM PIRANHA FEATURES AN OVERSIZED PIRANHA POISED TO BITE THE LEG OF AN UNSUSPECTING WOMAN.

STEP 4. EXPLAIN THE EXAMPLE(S)
THE NEXT MOVEMENT IN PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT IS AN EXPLANATION OF EACH EXAMPLE AND ITS RELEVANCE TO THE TOPIC SENTENCE. THE EXPLANATION SHOULD DEMONSTRATE THE VALUE OF THE EXAMPLE AS EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE MAJOR CLAIM, OR FOCUS, IN YOUR PARAGRAPH.

CONTINUE THE PATTERN OF GIVING EXAMPLES AND EXPLAINING THEM UNTIL ALL POINTS/EXAMPLES THAT THE WRITER DEEMS NECESSARY HAVE BEEN MADE AND EXPLAINED. NONE OF YOUR EXAMPLES SHOULD BE LEFT UNEXPLAINED. YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE EXAMPLE AND THE TOPIC SENTENCE IN THE SAME SENTENCE WHICH INTRODUCED THE EXAMPLE. MORE OFTEN, HOWEVER, YOU WILL NEED TO EXPLAIN THAT RELATIONSHIP IN A SEPARATE SENTENCE.

EXPLANATION FOR EXAMPLE — SUCH A TERRIFYING REPRESENTATION EASILY CAPTURES THE IMAGINATION AND PROMOTES UNNECESSARY FEAR.

NOTICE THAT THE EXAMPLE AND EXPLANATION STEPS OF THIS 5-STEP PROCESS (STEPS 3 AND 4) CAN BE REPEATED AS NEEDED. THE IDEA IS THAT YOU CONTINUE TO USE THIS PATTERN UNTIL YOU HAVE COMPLETELY DEVELOPED THE MAIN IDEA OF THE PARAGRAPH.

STEP 5. COMPLETE THE PARAGRAPH’S IDEA OR TRANSITION INTO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH
THE FINAL MOVEMENT IN PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT INVOLVES TYING UP THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE PARAGRAPH. AT THIS POINT, YOU CAN REMIND YOUR READER ABOUT THE RELEVANCE OF THE INFORMATION TO THE LARGER PAPER, OR YOU CAN MAKE A CONCLUDING POINT FOR THIS EXAMPLE. YOU MIGHT, HOWEVER, SIMPLY TRANSITION TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH.

SENTENCES FOR COMPLETING A PARAGRAPH — WHILE THE TROPE OF THE MAN-EATING PIRANHAS LENDS EXCITEMENT TO THE ADVENTURE STORIES, IT BEARS LITTLE RESEMBLANCE TO THE REAL-LIFE PIRANHA. BY PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO FACT THAN FICTION, HUMANS MAY FINALLY BE ABLE TO LET GO OF THIS INACCURATE BELIEF.

FINISHED PARAGRAPH
DESPITE THE FACT THAT PIRANHAS ARE RELATIVELY HARMLESS, MANY PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THE PERVASIVE MYTH THAT PIRANHAS ARE DANGEROUS TO HUMANS. THIS IMPRESSION OF PIRANHAS IS EXACERBATED BY THEIR MISCHARACTERIZATION IN POPULAR MEDIA. FOR EXAMPLE, THE PROMOTIONAL POSTER FOR THE 1978 HORROR FILM PIRANHA FEATURES AN OVERSIZED PIRANHA POISED TO BITE THE LEG OF AN UNSUSPECTING WOMAN. SUCH A TERRIFYING REPRESENTATION EASILY CAPTURES THE IMAGINATION AND PROMOTES UNNECESSARY FEAR. WHILE THE TROPE OF THE MAN-EATING PIRANHAS LENDS EXCITEMENT TO THE ADVENTURE STORIES, IT BEARS LITTLE RESEMBLANCE TO THE REAL-LIFE PIRANHA. BY PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO FACT THAN FICTION, HUMANS MAY FINALLY BE ABLE TO LET GO OF THIS INACCURATE BELIEF.

TROUBLESHOOTING PARAGRAPHS
PROBLEM: THE PARAGRAPH HAS NO TOPIC SENTENCE
IMAGINE EACH PARAGRAPH AS A SANDWICH. THE REAL CONTENT OF THE SANDWICH—THE MEAT OR OTHER FILLING—IS IN THE MIDDLE. IT INCLUDES ALL THE EVIDENCE YOU NEED TO MAKE THE POINT. BUT IT GETS KIND OF MESSY TO EAT A SANDWICH WITHOUT ANY BREAD. YOUR READERS DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH ALL THE EVIDENCE YOU’VE GIVEN THEM. SO, THE TOP SLICE OF BREAD (THE FIRST SENTENCE OF THE PARAGRAPH) EXPLAINS THE TOPIC (OR CONTROLLING IDEA) OF THE PARAGRAPH. AND, THE BOTTOM SLICE (THE LAST SENTENCE OF THE PARAGRAPH) TELLS THE READER HOW THE PARAGRAPH RELATES TO THE BROADER ARGUMENT. IN THE ORIGINAL AND REVISED PARAGRAPHS BELOW, NOTICE HOW A TOPIC SENTENCE EXPRESSING THE CONTROLLING IDEA TELLS THE READER THE POINT OF ALL THE EVIDENCE.

ORIGINAL PARAGRAPH

PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ FIRST INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. THEIR FEAR OF HUMANS MAKES SENSE. FAR MORE PIRANHAS ARE EATEN BY PEOPLE THAN PEOPLE ARE EATEN BY PIRANHAS. IF THE FISH ARE WELL-FED, THEY WON’T BITE HUMANS.

REVISED PARAGRAPH

ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER PIRANHAS TO BE QUITE DANGEROUS, THEY ARE, FOR THE MOST PART, ENTIRELY HARMLESS. PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ FIRST INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. THEIR FEAR OF HUMANS MAKES SENSE. FAR MORE PIRANHAS ARE EATEN BY PEOPLE THAN PEOPLE ARE EATEN BY PIRANHAS. IF THE FISH ARE WELL-FED, THEY WON’T BITE HUMANS.

ONCE YOU HAVE MASTERED THE USE OF TOPIC SENTENCES, YOU MAY DECIDE THAT THE TOPIC SENTENCE FOR A PARTICULAR PARAGRAPH REALLY SHOULDN’T BE THE FIRST SENTENCE OF THE PARAGRAPH. THIS IS FINE—THE TOPIC SENTENCE CAN ACTUALLY GO AT THE BEGINNING, MIDDLE, OR END OF A PARAGRAPH; WHAT’S IMPORTANT IS THAT IT IS IN THERE SOMEWHERE SO THAT READERS KNOW WHAT THE MAIN IDEA OF THE PARAGRAPH IS AND HOW IT RELATES BACK TO THE THESIS OF YOUR PAPER. SUPPOSE THAT WE WANTED TO START THE PIRANHA PARAGRAPH WITH A TRANSITION SENTENCE—SOMETHING THAT REMINDS THE READER OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH—RATHER THAN WITH THE TOPIC SENTENCE. LET’S SUPPOSE THAT THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH WAS ABOUT ALL KINDS OF ANIMALS THAT PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF, LIKE SHARKS, SNAKES, AND SPIDERS. OUR PARAGRAPH MIGHT LOOK LIKE THIS (THE TOPIC SENTENCE IS BOLD):

LIKE SHARKS, SNAKES, AND SPIDERS, PIRANHAS ARE WIDELY FEARED. ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER PIRANHAS TO BE QUITE DANGEROUS, THEY ARE, FOR THE MOST PART, ENTIRELY HARMLESS. PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ FIRST INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. THEIR FEAR OF HUMANS MAKES SENSE. FAR MORE PIRANHAS ARE EATEN BY PEOPLE THAN PEOPLE ARE EATEN BY PIRANHAS. IF THE FISH ARE WELL-FED, THEY WON’T BITE HUMANS.

PROBLEM: THE PARAGRAPH HAS MORE THAN ONE CONTROLLING IDEA
IF A PARAGRAPH HAS MORE THAN ONE MAIN IDEA, CONSIDER ELIMINATING SENTENCES THAT RELATE TO THE SECOND IDEA, OR SPLIT THE PARAGRAPH INTO TWO OR MORE PARAGRAPHS, EACH WITH ONLY ONE MAIN IDEA. WATCH OUR SHORT VIDEO ON REVERSE OUTLINING TO LEARN A QUICK WAY TO TEST WHETHER YOUR PARAGRAPHS ARE UNIFIED. IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH, THE FINAL TWO SENTENCES BRANCH OFF INTO A DIFFERENT TOPIC; SO, THE REVISED PARAGRAPH ELIMINATES THEM AND CONCLUDES WITH A SENTENCE THAT REMINDS THE READER OF THE PARAGRAPH’S MAIN IDEA.

ORIGINAL PARAGRAPH

ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER PIRANHAS TO BE QUITE DANGEROUS, THEY ARE, FOR THE MOST PART, ENTIRELY HARMLESS. PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ FIRST INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. THEIR FEAR OF HUMANS MAKES SENSE. FAR MORE PIRANHAS ARE EATEN BY PEOPLE THAN PEOPLE ARE EATEN BY PIRANHAS. A NUMBER OF SOUTH AMERICAN GROUPS EAT PIRANHAS. THEY FRY OR GRILL THE FISH AND THEN SERVE THEM WITH COCONUT MILK OR TUCUPI, A SAUCE MADE FROM FERMENTED MANIOC JUICES.

REVISED PARAGRAPH

ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER PIRANHAS TO BE QUITE DANGEROUS, THEY ARE, FOR THE MOST PART, ENTIRELY HARMLESS. PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ FIRST INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. THEIR FEAR OF HUMANS MAKES SENSE. FAR MORE PIRANHAS ARE EATEN BY PEOPLE THAN PEOPLE ARE EATEN BY PIRANHAS. IF THE FISH ARE WELL-FED, THEY WON’T BITE HUMANS.

PROBLEM: TRANSITIONS ARE NEEDED WITHIN THE PARAGRAPH
YOU ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH THE IDEA THAT TRANSITIONS MAY BE NEEDED BETWEEN PARAGRAPHS OR SECTIONS IN A PAPER (SEE OUR HANDOUT ON TRANSITIONS). SOMETIMES THEY ARE ALSO HELPFUL WITHIN THE BODY OF A SINGLE PARAGRAPH. WITHIN A PARAGRAPH, TRANSITIONS ARE OFTEN SINGLE WORDS OR SHORT PHRASES THAT HELP TO ESTABLISH RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN IDEAS AND TO CREATE A LOGICAL PROGRESSION OF THOSE IDEAS IN A PARAGRAPH. THIS IS ESPECIALLY LIKELY TO BE TRUE WITHIN PARAGRAPHS THAT DISCUSS MULTIPLE EXAMPLES. LET’S TAKE A LOOK AT A VERSION OF OUR PIRANHA PARAGRAPH THAT USES TRANSITIONS TO ORIENT THE READER:

ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER PIRANHAS TO BE QUITE DANGEROUS, THEY ARE, EXCEPT IN TWO MAIN SITUATIONS, ENTIRELY HARMLESS. PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. BUT THERE ARE TWO SITUATIONS IN WHICH A PIRANHA BITE IS LIKELY. THE FIRST IS WHEN A FRIGHTENED PIRANHA IS LIFTED OUT OF THE WATER—FOR EXAMPLE, IF IT HAS BEEN CAUGHT IN A FISHING NET. THE SECOND IS WHEN THE WATER LEVEL IN POOLS WHERE PIRANHAS ARE LIVING FALLS TOO LOW. A LARGE NUMBER OF FISH MAY BE TRAPPED IN A SINGLE POOL, AND IF THEY ARE HUNGRY, THEY MAY ATTACK ANYTHING THAT ENTERS THE WATER.

IN THIS EXAMPLE, YOU CAN SEE HOW THE PHRASES “THE FIRST” AND “THE SECOND” HELP THE READER FOLLOW THE ORGANIZATION OF THE IDEAS IN THE PARAGRAPH.

PARAGRAPHS
WHAT THIS HANDOUT IS ABOUT
THIS HANDOUT WILL HELP YOU UNDERSTAND HOW PARAGRAPHS ARE FORMED, HOW TO DEVELOP STRONGER PARAGRAPHS, AND HOW TO COMPLETELY AND CLEARLY EXPRESS YOUR IDEAS.

WHAT IS A PARAGRAPH?
PARAGRAPHS ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF PAPERS. MANY STUDENTS DEFINE PARAGRAPHS IN TERMS OF LENGTH: A PARAGRAPH IS A GROUP OF AT LEAST FIVE SENTENCES, A PARAGRAPH IS HALF A PAGE LONG, ETC. IN REALITY, THOUGH, THE UNITY AND COHERENCE OF IDEAS AMONG SENTENCES IS WHAT CONSTITUTES A PARAGRAPH. A PARAGRAPH IS DEFINED AS “A GROUP OF SENTENCES OR A SINGLE SENTENCE THAT FORMS A UNIT” (LUNSFORD AND CONNORS 116). LENGTH AND APPEARANCE DO NOT DETERMINE WHETHER A SECTION IN A PAPER IS A PARAGRAPH. FOR INSTANCE, IN SOME STYLES OF WRITING, PARTICULARLY JOURNALISTIC STYLES, A PARAGRAPH CAN BE JUST ONE SENTENCE LONG. ULTIMATELY, A PARAGRAPH IS A SENTENCE OR GROUP OF SENTENCES THAT SUPPORT ONE MAIN IDEA. IN THIS HANDOUT, WE WILL REFER TO THIS AS THE “CONTROLLING IDEA,” BECAUSE IT CONTROLS WHAT HAPPENS IN THE REST OF THE PARAGRAPH.
HOW DO I DECIDE WHAT TO PUT IN A PARAGRAPH?
BEFORE YOU CAN BEGIN TO DETERMINE WHAT THE COMPOSITION OF A PARTICULAR PARAGRAPH WILL BE, YOU MUST FIRST DECIDE ON AN ARGUMENT AND A WORKING THESIS STATEMENT FOR YOUR PAPER. WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT IDEA THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO CONVEY TO YOUR READER? THE INFORMATION IN EACH PARAGRAPH MUST BE RELATED TO THAT IDEA. IN OTHER WORDS, YOUR PARAGRAPHS SHOULD REMIND YOUR READER THAT THERE IS A RECURRENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOUR THESIS AND THE INFORMATION IN EACH PARAGRAPH. A WORKING THESIS FUNCTIONS LIKE A SEED FROM WHICH YOUR PAPER, AND YOUR IDEAS, WILL GROW. THE WHOLE PROCESS IS AN ORGANIC ONE—A NATURAL PROGRESSION FROM A SEED TO A FULL-BLOWN PAPER WHERE THERE ARE DIRECT, FAMILIAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ALL OF THE IDEAS IN THE PAPER.

THE DECISION ABOUT WHAT TO PUT INTO YOUR PARAGRAPHS BEGINS WITH THE GERMINATION OF A SEED OF IDEAS; THIS “GERMINATION PROCESS” IS BETTER KNOWN AS BRAINSTORMING. THERE ARE MANY TECHNIQUES FOR BRAINSTORMING; WHICHEVER ONE YOU CHOOSE, THIS STAGE OF PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT CANNOT BE SKIPPED. BUILDING PARAGRAPHS CAN BE LIKE BUILDING A SKYSCRAPER: THERE MUST BE A WELL-PLANNED FOUNDATION THAT SUPPORTS WHAT YOU ARE BUILDING. ANY CRACKS, INCONSISTENCIES, OR OTHER CORRUPTIONS OF THE FOUNDATION CAN CAUSE YOUR WHOLE PAPER TO CRUMBLE.

SO, LET’S SUPPOSE THAT YOU HAVE DONE SOME BRAINSTORMING TO DEVELOP YOUR THESIS. WHAT ELSE SHOULD YOU KEEP IN MIND AS YOU BEGIN TO CREATE PARAGRAPHS? EVERY PARAGRAPH IN A PAPER SHOULD BE:

UNIFIED: ALL OF THE SENTENCES IN A SINGLE PARAGRAPH SHOULD BE RELATED TO A SINGLE CONTROLLING IDEA (OFTEN EXPRESSED IN THE TOPIC SENTENCE OF THE PARAGRAPH).
CLEARLY RELATED TO THE THESIS: THE SENTENCES SHOULD ALL REFER TO THE CENTRAL IDEA, OR THESIS, OF THE PAPER (ROSEN AND BEHRENS 119).
COHERENT: THE SENTENCES SHOULD BE ARRANGED IN A LOGICAL MANNER AND SHOULD FOLLOW A DEFINITE PLAN FOR DEVELOPMENT (ROSEN AND BEHRENS 119).
WELL-DEVELOPED: EVERY IDEA DISCUSSED IN THE PARAGRAPH SHOULD BE ADEQUATELY EXPLAINED AND SUPPORTED THROUGH EVIDENCE AND DETAILS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO EXPLAIN THE PARAGRAPH’S CONTROLLING IDEA (ROSEN AND BEHRENS 119).
HOW DO I ORGANIZE A PARAGRAPH?
THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS TO ORGANIZE A PARAGRAPH. THE ORGANIZATION YOU CHOOSE WILL DEPEND ON THE CONTROLLING IDEA OF THE PARAGRAPH. BELOW ARE A FEW POSSIBILITIES FOR ORGANIZATION, WITH LINKS TO BRIEF EXAMPLES:

NARRATION: TELL A STORY. GO CHRONOLOGICALLY, FROM START TO FINISH. (SEE AN EXAMPLE.)
DESCRIPTION: PROVIDE SPECIFIC DETAILS ABOUT WHAT SOMETHING LOOKS, SMELLS, TASTES, SOUNDS, OR FEELS LIKE. ORGANIZE SPATIALLY, IN ORDER OF APPEARANCE, OR BY TOPIC. (SEE AN EXAMPLE.)
PROCESS: EXPLAIN HOW SOMETHING WORKS, STEP BY STEP. PERHAPS FOLLOW A SEQUENCE—FIRST, SECOND, THIRD. (SEE AN EXAMPLE.)
CLASSIFICATION: SEPARATE INTO GROUPS OR EXPLAIN THE VARIOUS PARTS OF A TOPIC. (SEE AN EXAMPLE.)
ILLUSTRATION: GIVE EXAMPLES AND EXPLAIN HOW THOSE EXAMPLES SUPPORT YOUR POINT. (SEE AN EXAMPLE IN THE 5-STEP PROCESS BELOW.)
ILLUSTRATION PARAGRAPH: A 5-STEP EXAMPLE
FROM THE LIST ABOVE, LET’S CHOOSE “ILLUSTRATION” AS OUR RHETORICAL PURPOSE. WE’LL WALK THROUGH A 5-STEP PROCESS FOR BUILDING A PARAGRAPH THAT ILLUSTRATES A POINT IN AN ARGUMENT. FOR EACH STEP THERE IS AN EXPLANATION AND EXAMPLE. OUR EXAMPLE PARAGRAPH WILL BE ABOUT HUMAN MISCONCEPTIONS OF PIRANHAS.

STEP 1. DECIDE ON A CONTROLLING IDEA AND CREATE A TOPIC SENTENCE
PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT BEGINS WITH THE FORMULATION OF THE CONTROLLING IDEA. THIS IDEA DIRECTS THE PARAGRAPH’S DEVELOPMENT. OFTEN, THE CONTROLLING IDEA OF A PARAGRAPH WILL APPEAR IN THE FORM OF A TOPIC SENTENCE. IN SOME CASES, YOU MAY NEED MORE THAN ONE SENTENCE TO EXPRESS A PARAGRAPH’S CONTROLLING IDEA.

CONTROLLING IDEA AND TOPIC SENTENCE — DESPITE THE FACT THAT PIRANHAS ARE RELATIVELY HARMLESS, MANY PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THE PERVASIVE MYTH THAT PIRANHAS ARE DANGEROUS TO HUMANS.

STEP 2. ELABORATE ON THE CONTROLLING IDEA
PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT CONTINUES WITH AN ELABORATION ON THE CONTROLLING IDEA, PERHAPS WITH AN EXPLANATION, IMPLICATION, OR STATEMENT ABOUT SIGNIFICANCE. OUR EXAMPLE OFFERS A POSSIBLE EXPLANATION FOR THE PERVASIVENESS OF THE MYTH.

ELABORATION — THIS IMPRESSION OF PIRANHAS IS EXACERBATED BY THEIR MISCHARACTERIZATION IN POPULAR MEDIA.

STEP 3. GIVE AN EXAMPLE (OR MULTIPLE EXAMPLES)
PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT PROGRESSES WITH AN EXAMPLE (OR MORE) THAT ILLUSTRATES THE CLAIMS MADE IN THE PREVIOUS SENTENCES.

EXAMPLE — FOR EXAMPLE, THE PROMOTIONAL POSTER FOR THE 1978 HORROR FILM PIRANHA FEATURES AN OVERSIZED PIRANHA POISED TO BITE THE LEG OF AN UNSUSPECTING WOMAN.

STEP 4. EXPLAIN THE EXAMPLE(S)
THE NEXT MOVEMENT IN PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT IS AN EXPLANATION OF EACH EXAMPLE AND ITS RELEVANCE TO THE TOPIC SENTENCE. THE EXPLANATION SHOULD DEMONSTRATE THE VALUE OF THE EXAMPLE AS EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE MAJOR CLAIM, OR FOCUS, IN YOUR PARAGRAPH.

CONTINUE THE PATTERN OF GIVING EXAMPLES AND EXPLAINING THEM UNTIL ALL POINTS/EXAMPLES THAT THE WRITER DEEMS NECESSARY HAVE BEEN MADE AND EXPLAINED. NONE OF YOUR EXAMPLES SHOULD BE LEFT UNEXPLAINED. YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE EXAMPLE AND THE TOPIC SENTENCE IN THE SAME SENTENCE WHICH INTRODUCED THE EXAMPLE. MORE OFTEN, HOWEVER, YOU WILL NEED TO EXPLAIN THAT RELATIONSHIP IN A SEPARATE SENTENCE.

EXPLANATION FOR EXAMPLE — SUCH A TERRIFYING REPRESENTATION EASILY CAPTURES THE IMAGINATION AND PROMOTES UNNECESSARY FEAR.

NOTICE THAT THE EXAMPLE AND EXPLANATION STEPS OF THIS 5-STEP PROCESS (STEPS 3 AND 4) CAN BE REPEATED AS NEEDED. THE IDEA IS THAT YOU CONTINUE TO USE THIS PATTERN UNTIL YOU HAVE COMPLETELY DEVELOPED THE MAIN IDEA OF THE PARAGRAPH.

STEP 5. COMPLETE THE PARAGRAPH’S IDEA OR TRANSITION INTO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH
THE FINAL MOVEMENT IN PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT INVOLVES TYING UP THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE PARAGRAPH. AT THIS POINT, YOU CAN REMIND YOUR READER ABOUT THE RELEVANCE OF THE INFORMATION TO THE LARGER PAPER, OR YOU CAN MAKE A CONCLUDING POINT FOR THIS EXAMPLE. YOU MIGHT, HOWEVER, SIMPLY TRANSITION TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH.

SENTENCES FOR COMPLETING A PARAGRAPH — WHILE THE TROPE OF THE MAN-EATING PIRANHAS LENDS EXCITEMENT TO THE ADVENTURE STORIES, IT BEARS LITTLE RESEMBLANCE TO THE REAL-LIFE PIRANHA. BY PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO FACT THAN FICTION, HUMANS MAY FINALLY BE ABLE TO LET GO OF THIS INACCURATE BELIEF.

FINISHED PARAGRAPH
DESPITE THE FACT THAT PIRANHAS ARE RELATIVELY HARMLESS, MANY PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THE PERVASIVE MYTH THAT PIRANHAS ARE DANGEROUS TO HUMANS. THIS IMPRESSION OF PIRANHAS IS EXACERBATED BY THEIR MISCHARACTERIZATION IN POPULAR MEDIA. FOR EXAMPLE, THE PROMOTIONAL POSTER FOR THE 1978 HORROR FILM PIRANHA FEATURES AN OVERSIZED PIRANHA POISED TO BITE THE LEG OF AN UNSUSPECTING WOMAN. SUCH A TERRIFYING REPRESENTATION EASILY CAPTURES THE IMAGINATION AND PROMOTES UNNECESSARY FEAR. WHILE THE TROPE OF THE MAN-EATING PIRANHAS LENDS EXCITEMENT TO THE ADVENTURE STORIES, IT BEARS LITTLE RESEMBLANCE TO THE REAL-LIFE PIRANHA. BY PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO FACT THAN FICTION, HUMANS MAY FINALLY BE ABLE TO LET GO OF THIS INACCURATE BELIEF.

TROUBLESHOOTING PARAGRAPHS
PROBLEM: THE PARAGRAPH HAS NO TOPIC SENTENCE
IMAGINE EACH PARAGRAPH AS A SANDWICH. THE REAL CONTENT OF THE SANDWICH—THE MEAT OR OTHER FILLING—IS IN THE MIDDLE. IT INCLUDES ALL THE EVIDENCE YOU NEED TO MAKE THE POINT. BUT IT GETS KIND OF MESSY TO EAT A SANDWICH WITHOUT ANY BREAD. YOUR READERS DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH ALL THE EVIDENCE YOU’VE GIVEN THEM. SO, THE TOP SLICE OF BREAD (THE FIRST SENTENCE OF THE PARAGRAPH) EXPLAINS THE TOPIC (OR CONTROLLING IDEA) OF THE PARAGRAPH. AND, THE BOTTOM SLICE (THE LAST SENTENCE OF THE PARAGRAPH) TELLS THE READER HOW THE PARAGRAPH RELATES TO THE BROADER ARGUMENT. IN THE ORIGINAL AND REVISED PARAGRAPHS BELOW, NOTICE HOW A TOPIC SENTENCE EXPRESSING THE CONTROLLING IDEA TELLS THE READER THE POINT OF ALL THE EVIDENCE.

ORIGINAL PARAGRAPH

PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ FIRST INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. THEIR FEAR OF HUMANS MAKES SENSE. FAR MORE PIRANHAS ARE EATEN BY PEOPLE THAN PEOPLE ARE EATEN BY PIRANHAS. IF THE FISH ARE WELL-FED, THEY WON’T BITE HUMANS.

REVISED PARAGRAPH

ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER PIRANHAS TO BE QUITE DANGEROUS, THEY ARE, FOR THE MOST PART, ENTIRELY HARMLESS. PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ FIRST INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. THEIR FEAR OF HUMANS MAKES SENSE. FAR MORE PIRANHAS ARE EATEN BY PEOPLE THAN PEOPLE ARE EATEN BY PIRANHAS. IF THE FISH ARE WELL-FED, THEY WON’T BITE HUMANS.

ONCE YOU HAVE MASTERED THE USE OF TOPIC SENTENCES, YOU MAY DECIDE THAT THE TOPIC SENTENCE FOR A PARTICULAR PARAGRAPH REALLY SHOULDN’T BE THE FIRST SENTENCE OF THE PARAGRAPH. THIS IS FINE—THE TOPIC SENTENCE CAN ACTUALLY GO AT THE BEGINNING, MIDDLE, OR END OF A PARAGRAPH; WHAT’S IMPORTANT IS THAT IT IS IN THERE SOMEWHERE SO THAT READERS KNOW WHAT THE MAIN IDEA OF THE PARAGRAPH IS AND HOW IT RELATES BACK TO THE THESIS OF YOUR PAPER. SUPPOSE THAT WE WANTED TO START THE PIRANHA PARAGRAPH WITH A TRANSITION SENTENCE—SOMETHING THAT REMINDS THE READER OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH—RATHER THAN WITH THE TOPIC SENTENCE. LET’S SUPPOSE THAT THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH WAS ABOUT ALL KINDS OF ANIMALS THAT PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF, LIKE SHARKS, SNAKES, AND SPIDERS. OUR PARAGRAPH MIGHT LOOK LIKE THIS (THE TOPIC SENTENCE IS BOLD):

LIKE SHARKS, SNAKES, AND SPIDERS, PIRANHAS ARE WIDELY FEARED. ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER PIRANHAS TO BE QUITE DANGEROUS, THEY ARE, FOR THE MOST PART, ENTIRELY HARMLESS. PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ FIRST INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. THEIR FEAR OF HUMANS MAKES SENSE. FAR MORE PIRANHAS ARE EATEN BY PEOPLE THAN PEOPLE ARE EATEN BY PIRANHAS. IF THE FISH ARE WELL-FED, THEY WON’T BITE HUMANS.

PROBLEM: THE PARAGRAPH HAS MORE THAN ONE CONTROLLING IDEA
IF A PARAGRAPH HAS MORE THAN ONE MAIN IDEA, CONSIDER ELIMINATING SENTENCES THAT RELATE TO THE SECOND IDEA, OR SPLIT THE PARAGRAPH INTO TWO OR MORE PARAGRAPHS, EACH WITH ONLY ONE MAIN IDEA. WATCH OUR SHORT VIDEO ON REVERSE OUTLINING TO LEARN A QUICK WAY TO TEST WHETHER YOUR PARAGRAPHS ARE UNIFIED. IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH, THE FINAL TWO SENTENCES BRANCH OFF INTO A DIFFERENT TOPIC; SO, THE REVISED PARAGRAPH ELIMINATES THEM AND CONCLUDES WITH A SENTENCE THAT REMINDS THE READER OF THE PARAGRAPH’S MAIN IDEA.

ORIGINAL PARAGRAPH

ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER PIRANHAS TO BE QUITE DANGEROUS, THEY ARE, FOR THE MOST PART, ENTIRELY HARMLESS. PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ FIRST INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. THEIR FEAR OF HUMANS MAKES SENSE. FAR MORE PIRANHAS ARE EATEN BY PEOPLE THAN PEOPLE ARE EATEN BY PIRANHAS. A NUMBER OF SOUTH AMERICAN GROUPS EAT PIRANHAS. THEY FRY OR GRILL THE FISH AND THEN SERVE THEM WITH COCONUT MILK OR TUCUPI, A SAUCE MADE FROM FERMENTED MANIOC JUICES.

REVISED PARAGRAPH

ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER PIRANHAS TO BE QUITE DANGEROUS, THEY ARE, FOR THE MOST PART, ENTIRELY HARMLESS. PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ FIRST INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. THEIR FEAR OF HUMANS MAKES SENSE. FAR MORE PIRANHAS ARE EATEN BY PEOPLE THAN PEOPLE ARE EATEN BY PIRANHAS. IF THE FISH ARE WELL-FED, THEY WON’T BITE HUMANS.

PROBLEM: TRANSITIONS ARE NEEDED WITHIN THE PARAGRAPH
YOU ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH THE IDEA THAT TRANSITIONS MAY BE NEEDED BETWEEN PARAGRAPHS OR SECTIONS IN A PAPER (SEE OUR HANDOUT ON TRANSITIONS). SOMETIMES THEY ARE ALSO HELPFUL WITHIN THE BODY OF A SINGLE PARAGRAPH. WITHIN A PARAGRAPH, TRANSITIONS ARE OFTEN SINGLE WORDS OR SHORT PHRASES THAT HELP TO ESTABLISH RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN IDEAS AND TO CREATE A LOGICAL PROGRESSION OF THOSE IDEAS IN A PARAGRAPH. THIS IS ESPECIALLY LIKELY TO BE TRUE WITHIN PARAGRAPHS THAT DISCUSS MULTIPLE EXAMPLES. LET’S TAKE A LOOK AT A VERSION OF OUR PIRANHA PARAGRAPH THAT USES TRANSITIONS TO ORIENT THE READER:

ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER PIRANHAS TO BE QUITE DANGEROUS, THEY ARE, EXCEPT IN TWO MAIN SITUATIONS, ENTIRELY HARMLESS. PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. BUT THERE ARE TWO SITUATIONS IN WHICH A PIRANHA BITE IS LIKELY. THE FIRST IS WHEN A FRIGHTENED PIRANHA IS LIFTED OUT OF THE WATER—FOR EXAMPLE, IF IT HAS BEEN CAUGHT IN A FISHING NET. THE SECOND IS WHEN THE WATER LEVEL IN POOLS WHERE PIRANHAS ARE LIVING FALLS TOO LOW. A LARGE NUMBER OF FISH MAY BE TRAPPED IN A SINGLE POOL, AND IF THEY ARE HUNGRY, THEY MAY ATTACK ANYTHING THAT ENTERS THE WATER.

IN THIS EXAMPLE, YOU CAN SEE HOW THE PHRASES “THE FIRST” AND “THE SECOND” HELP THE READER FOLLOW THE ORGANIZATION OF THE IDEAS IN THE PARAGRAPH.

BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY IS AN ADVANCED DATABASE MECHANISM THAT ALLOWS TRANSPARENT INFORMATION SHARING WITHIN A BUSINESS 
NETWORK. A BLOCKCHAIN DATABASE STORES DATA IN BLOCKS THAT ARE LINKED TOGETHER IN A CHAIN. THE DATA IS CHRONOLOGICALLY 
CONSISTENT BECAUSE YOU CANNOT DELETE OR MODIFY THE CHAIN WITHOUT CONSENSUS FROM THE NETWORK. AS A RESULT, YOU CAN USE
 BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE AN UNALTERABLE OR IMMUTABLE LEDGER FOR TRACKING ORDERS, PAYMENTS, ACCOUNTS, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS. THE SYSTEM HAS BUILT-IN MECHANISMS THAT PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTION ENTRIES AND CREATE CONSISTENCY IN THE SHARED VIEW OF THESE TRANSACTIONS.
TRADITIONAL DATABASE TECHNOLOGIES PRESENT SEVERAL CHALLENGES FOR RECORDING FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS. FOR INSTANCE, CONSIDER THE SALE OF A PROPERTY. ONCE THE MONEY IS EXCHANGED, OWNERSHIP OF THE PROPERTY IS TRANSFERRED TO THE BUYER. INDIVIDUALLY, BOTH THE BUYER AND THE SELLER CAN RECORD THE MONETARY TRANSACTIONS, BUT NEITHER SOURCE CAN BE TRUSTED. THE SELLER CAN EASILY CLAIM THEY HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE MONEY EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE, AND THE BUYER CAN EQUALLY ARGUE THAT THEY HAVE PAID THE MONEY EVEN IF THEY HAVEN’T.

TO AVOID POTENTIAL LEGAL ISSUES, A TRUSTED THIRD PARTY HAS TO SUPERVISE AND VALIDATE TRANSACTIONS. THE PRESENCE OF THIS CENTRAL AUTHORITY NOT ONLY COMPLICATES THE TRANSACTION BUT ALSO CREATES A SINGLE POINT OF VULNERABILITY. IF THE CENTRAL DATABASE WAS COMPROMISED, BOTH PARTIES COULD SUFFER.

BLOCKCHAIN MITIGATES SUCH ISSUES BY CREATING A DECENTRALIZED, TAMPER-PROOF SYSTEM TO RECORD TRANSACTIONS. IN THE PROPERTY TRANSACTION SCENARIO, BLOCKCHAIN CREATES ONE LEDGER EACH FOR THE BUYER AND THE SELLER. ALL TRANSACTIONS MUST BE APPROVED BY BOTH PARTIES AND ARE AUTOMATICALLY UPDATED IN BOTH OF THEIR LEDGERS IN REAL TIME. ANY CORRUPTION IN HISTORICAL TRANSACTIONS WILL CORRUPT THE ENTIRE LEDGER. THESE PROPERTIES OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY HAVE LED TO ITS USE IN VARIOUS SECTORS, INCLUDING THE CREATION OF DIGITAL CURRENCY LIKE BITCOIN.
HOW DO DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES USE BLOCKCHAIN?
BLOCKCHAIN IS AN EMERGING TECHNOLOGY THAT IS BEING ADOPTED IN INNOVATIVE MANNER BY VARIOUS INDUSTRIES. WE DESCRIBE SOME USE CASES IN DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES IN THE FOLLOWING SUBSECTIONS:


ENERGY
ENERGY COMPANIES USE BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE PEER-TO-PEER ENERGY TRADING PLATFORMS AND STREAMLINE ACCESS TO RENEWABLE ENERGY. FOR EXAMPLE, CONSIDER THESE USES:

BLOCKCHAIN-BASED ENERGY COMPANIES HAVE CREATED A TRADING PLATFORM FOR THE SALE OF ELECTRICITY BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS. HOMEOWNERS WITH SOLAR PANELS USE THIS PLATFORM TO SELL THEIR EXCESS SOLAR ENERGY TO NEIGHBORS. THE PROCESS IS LARGELY AUTOMATED: SMART METERS CREATE TRANSACTIONS, AND BLOCKCHAIN RECORDS THEM.
WITH BLOCKCHAIN-BASED CROWD FUNDING INITIATIVES, USERS CAN SPONSOR AND OWN SOLAR PANELS IN COMMUNITIES THAT LACK ENERGY ACCESS. SPONSORS MIGHT ALSO RECEIVE RENT FOR THESE COMMUNITIES ONCE THE SOLAR PANELS ARE CONSTRUCTED.
FINANCE
TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL SYSTEMS, LIKE BANKS AND STOCK EXCHANGES, USE BLOCKCHAIN SERVICES TO MANAGE ONLINE PAYMENTS, ACCOUNTS, AND MARKET TRADING. FOR EXAMPLE, SINGAPORE EXCHANGE LIMITED, AN INVESTMENT HOLDING COMPANY THAT PROVIDES FINANCIAL TRADING SERVICES THROUGHOUT ASIA, USES BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY TO BUILD A MORE EFFICIENT INTERBANK PAYMENT ACCOUNT. BY ADOPTING BLOCKCHAIN, THEY SOLVED SEVERAL CHALLENGES, INCLUDING BATCH PROCESSING AND MANUAL RECONCILIATION OF SEVERAL THOUSAND FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS.

MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT
COMPANIES IN MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT USE BLOCKCHAIN SYSTEMS TO MANAGE COPYRIGHT DATA. COPYRIGHT VERIFICATION IS CRITICAL FOR THE FAIR COMPENSATION OF ARTISTS. IT TAKES MULTIPLE TRANSACTIONS TO RECORD THE SALE OR TRANSFER OF COPYRIGHT CONTENT. SONY MUSIC ENTERTAINMENT JAPAN USES BLOCKCHAIN SERVICES TO MAKE DIGITAL RIGHTS MANAGEMENT MORE EFFICIENT. THEY HAVE SUCCESSFULLY USED BLOCKCHAIN STRATEGY TO IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY AND REDUCE COSTS IN COPYRIGHT PROCESSING.

RETAIL
RETAIL COMPANIES USE BLOCKCHAIN TO TRACK THE MOVEMENT OF GOODS BETWEEN SUPPLIERS AND BUYERS. FOR EXAMPLE, AMAZON RETAIL HAS FILED A PATENT FOR A DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM THAT WILL USE BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY TO VERIFY THAT ALL GOODS SOLD ON THE PLATFORM ARE AUTHENTIC. AMAZON SELLERS CAN MAP THEIR GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS BY ALLOWING PARTICIPANTS SUCH AS MANUFACTURERS, COURIERS, DISTRIBUTORS, END USERS, AND SECONDARY USERS TO ADD EVENTS TO THE LEDGER AFTER REGISTERING WITH A CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY. 

WHAT ARE THE FEATURES OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY?
BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY HAS THE FOLLOWING MAIN FEATURES:

DECENTRALIZATION
DECENTRALIZATION IN BLOCKCHAIN REFERS TO TRANSFERRING CONTROL AND DECISION MAKING FROM A CENTRALIZED ENTITY (INDIVIDUAL, ORGANIZATION, OR GROUP) TO A DISTRIBUTED NETWORK. DECENTRALIZED BLOCKCHAIN NETWORKS USE TRANSPARENCY TO REDUCE THE NEED FOR TRUST AMONG PARTICIPANTS. THESE NETWORKS ALSO DETER PARTICIPANTS FROM EXERTING AUTHORITY OR CONTROL OVER ONE ANOTHER IN WAYS THAT DEGRADE THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE NETWORK.

IMMUTABILITY
IMMUTABILITY MEANS SOMETHING CANNOT BE CHANGED OR ALTERED. NO PARTICIPANT CAN TAMPER WITH A TRANSACTION ONCE SOMEONE HAS RECORDED IT TO THE SHARED LEDGER. IF A TRANSACTION RECORD INCLUDES AN ERROR, YOU MUST ADD A NEW TRANSACTION TO REVERSE THE MISTAKE, AND BOTH TRANSACTIONS ARE VISIBLE TO THE NETWORK.

CONSENSUS
A BLOCKCHAIN SYSTEM ESTABLISHES RULES ABOUT PARTICIPANT CONSENT FOR RECORDING TRANSACTIONS. YOU CAN RECORD NEW TRANSACTIONS ONLY WHEN THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE NETWORK GIVE THEIR CONSENT.

WHAT ARE THE KEY COMPONENTS OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY?
BLOCKCHAIN ARCHITECTURE HAS THE FOLLOWING MAIN COMPONENTS:

A DISTRIBUTED LEDGER

A DISTRIBUTED LEDGER IS THE SHARED DATABASE IN THE BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK THAT STORES THE TRANSACTIONS, SUCH AS A SHARED FILE THAT EVERYONE IN THE TEAM CAN EDIT. IN MOST SHARED TEXT EDITORS, ANYONE WITH EDITING RIGHTS CAN DELETE THE ENTIRE FILE. HOWEVER, DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGIES HAVE STRICT RULES ABOUT WHO CAN EDIT AND HOW TO EDIT. YOU CANNOT DELETE ENTRIES ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN RECORDED.

SMART CONTRACTS
COMPANIES USE SMART CONTRACTS TO SELF-MANAGE BUSINESS CONTRACTS WITHOUT THE NEED FOR AN ASSISTING THIRD PARTY. THEY ARE PROGRAMS STORED ON THE BLOCKCHAIN SYSTEM THAT RUN AUTOMATICALLY WHEN PREDETERMINED CONDITIONS ARE MET. THEY RUN IF-THEN CHECKS SO THAT TRANSACTIONS CAN BE COMPLETED CONFIDENTLY. FOR EXAMPLE, A LOGISTICS COMPANY CAN HAVE A SMART CONTRACT THAT AUTOMATICALLY MAKES PAYMENT ONCE GOODS HAVE ARRIVED AT THE PORT.

PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY
PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY IS A SECURITY FEATURE TO UNIQUELY IDENTIFY PARTICIPANTS IN THE BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK. THIS MECHANISM GENERATES TWO SETS OF KEYS FOR NETWORK MEMBERS. ONE KEY IS A PUBLIC KEY THAT IS COMMON TO EVERYONE IN THE NETWORK. THE OTHER IS A PRIVATE KEY THAT IS UNIQUE TO EVERY MEMBER. THE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC KEYS WORK TOGETHER TO UNLOCK THE DATA IN THE LEDGER. 

FOR EXAMPLE, JOHN AND JILL ARE TWO MEMBERS OF THE NETWORK. JOHN RECORDS A TRANSACTION THAT IS ENCRYPTED WITH HIS PRIVATE KEY. JILL CAN DECRYPT IT WITH HER PUBLIC KEY. THIS WAY, JILL IS CONFIDENT THAT JOHN MADE THE TRANSACTION. JILL'S PUBLIC KEY WOULDN'T HAVE WORKED IF JOHN'S PRIVATE KEY HAD BEEN TAMPERED WITH.

HOW DOES BLOCKCHAIN WORK?
WHILE UNDERLYING BLOCKCHAIN MECHANISMS ARE COMPLEX, WE GIVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW IN THE FOLLOWING STEPS. BLOCKCHAIN SOFTWARE CAN AUTOMATE MOST OF THESE STEPS:

STEP 1 – RECORD THE TRANSACTION
A BLOCKCHAIN TRANSACTION SHOWS THE MOVEMENT OF PHYSICAL OR DIGITAL ASSETS FROM ONE PARTY TO ANOTHER IN THE BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK. IT IS RECORDED AS A DATA BLOCK AND CAN INCLUDE DETAILS LIKE THESE:

WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THE TRANSACTION?
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE TRANSACTION?
WHEN DID THE TRANSACTION OCCUR?
WHERE DID THE TRANSACTION OCCUR?
WHY DID THE TRANSACTION OCCUR?
HOW MUCH OF THE ASSET WAS EXCHANGED?
HOW MANY PRE-CONDITIONS WERE MET DURING THE TRANSACTION?
STEP 2 – GAIN CONSENSUS

PARAGRAPHS
WHAT THIS HANDOUT IS ABOUT
THIS HANDOUT WILL HELP YOU UNDERSTAND HOW PARAGRAPHS ARE FORMED, HOW TO DEVELOP STRONGER PARAGRAPHS, AND HOW TO COMPLETELY AND CLEARLY EXPRESS YOUR IDEAS.

WHAT IS A PARAGRAPH?
PARAGRAPHS ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF PAPERS. MANY STUDENTS DEFINE PARAGRAPHS IN TERMS OF LENGTH: A PARAGRAPH IS A GROUP OF AT LEAST FIVE SENTENCES, A PARAGRAPH IS HALF A PAGE LONG, ETC. IN REALITY, THOUGH, THE UNITY AND COHERENCE OF IDEAS AMONG SENTENCES IS WHAT CONSTITUTES A PARAGRAPH. A PARAGRAPH IS DEFINED AS “A GROUP OF SENTENCES OR A SINGLE SENTENCE THAT FORMS A UNIT” (LUNSFORD AND CONNORS 116). LENGTH AND APPEARANCE DO NOT DETERMINE WHETHER A SECTION IN A PAPER IS A PARAGRAPH. FOR INSTANCE, IN SOME STYLES OF WRITING, PARTICULARLY JOURNALISTIC STYLES, A PARAGRAPH CAN BE JUST ONE SENTENCE LONG. ULTIMATELY, A PARAGRAPH IS A SENTENCE OR GROUP OF SENTENCES THAT SUPPORT ONE MAIN IDEA. IN THIS HANDOUT, WE WILL REFER TO THIS AS THE “CONTROLLING IDEA,” BECAUSE IT CONTROLS WHAT HAPPENS IN THE REST OF THE PARAGRAPH.
HOW DO I DECIDE WHAT TO PUT IN A PARAGRAPH?
BEFORE YOU CAN BEGIN TO DETERMINE WHAT THE COMPOSITION OF A PARTICULAR PARAGRAPH WILL BE, YOU MUST FIRST DECIDE ON AN ARGUMENT AND A WORKING THESIS STATEMENT FOR YOUR PAPER. WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT IDEA THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO CONVEY TO YOUR READER? THE INFORMATION IN EACH PARAGRAPH MUST BE RELATED TO THAT IDEA. IN OTHER WORDS, YOUR PARAGRAPHS SHOULD REMIND YOUR READER THAT THERE IS A RECURRENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOUR THESIS AND THE INFORMATION IN EACH PARAGRAPH. A WORKING THESIS FUNCTIONS LIKE A SEED FROM WHICH YOUR PAPER, AND YOUR IDEAS, WILL GROW. THE WHOLE PROCESS IS AN ORGANIC ONE—A NATURAL PROGRESSION FROM A SEED TO A FULL-BLOWN PAPER WHERE THERE ARE DIRECT, FAMILIAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ALL OF THE IDEAS IN THE PAPER.

THE DECISION ABOUT WHAT TO PUT INTO YOUR PARAGRAPHS BEGINS WITH THE GERMINATION OF A SEED OF IDEAS; THIS “GERMINATION PROCESS” IS BETTER KNOWN AS BRAINSTORMING. THERE ARE MANY TECHNIQUES FOR BRAINSTORMING; WHICHEVER ONE YOU CHOOSE, THIS STAGE OF PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT CANNOT BE SKIPPED. BUILDING PARAGRAPHS CAN BE LIKE BUILDING A SKYSCRAPER: THERE MUST BE A WELL-PLANNED FOUNDATION THAT SUPPORTS WHAT YOU ARE BUILDING. ANY CRACKS, INCONSISTENCIES, OR OTHER CORRUPTIONS OF THE FOUNDATION CAN CAUSE YOUR WHOLE PAPER TO CRUMBLE.

SO, LET’S SUPPOSE THAT YOU HAVE DONE SOME BRAINSTORMING TO DEVELOP YOUR THESIS. WHAT ELSE SHOULD YOU KEEP IN MIND AS YOU BEGIN TO CREATE PARAGRAPHS? EVERY PARAGRAPH IN A PAPER SHOULD BE:

UNIFIED: ALL OF THE SENTENCES IN A SINGLE PARAGRAPH SHOULD BE RELATED TO A SINGLE CONTROLLING IDEA (OFTEN EXPRESSED IN THE TOPIC SENTENCE OF THE PARAGRAPH).
CLEARLY RELATED TO THE THESIS: THE SENTENCES SHOULD ALL REFER TO THE CENTRAL IDEA, OR THESIS, OF THE PAPER (ROSEN AND BEHRENS 119).
COHERENT: THE SENTENCES SHOULD BE ARRANGED IN A LOGICAL MANNER AND SHOULD FOLLOW A DEFINITE PLAN FOR DEVELOPMENT (ROSEN AND BEHRENS 119).
WELL-DEVELOPED: EVERY IDEA DISCUSSED IN THE PARAGRAPH SHOULD BE ADEQUATELY EXPLAINED AND SUPPORTED THROUGH EVIDENCE AND DETAILS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO EXPLAIN THE PARAGRAPH’S CONTROLLING IDEA (ROSEN AND BEHRENS 119).
HOW DO I ORGANIZE A PARAGRAPH?
THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS TO ORGANIZE A PARAGRAPH. THE ORGANIZATION YOU CHOOSE WILL DEPEND ON THE CONTROLLING IDEA OF THE PARAGRAPH. BELOW ARE A FEW POSSIBILITIES FOR ORGANIZATION, WITH LINKS TO BRIEF EXAMPLES:

NARRATION: TELL A STORY. GO CHRONOLOGICALLY, FROM START TO FINISH. (SEE AN EXAMPLE.)
DESCRIPTION: PROVIDE SPECIFIC DETAILS ABOUT WHAT SOMETHING LOOKS, SMELLS, TASTES, SOUNDS, OR FEELS LIKE. ORGANIZE SPATIALLY, IN ORDER OF APPEARANCE, OR BY TOPIC. (SEE AN EXAMPLE.)
PROCESS: EXPLAIN HOW SOMETHING WORKS, STEP BY STEP. PERHAPS FOLLOW A SEQUENCE—FIRST, SECOND, THIRD. (SEE AN EXAMPLE.)
CLASSIFICATION: SEPARATE INTO GROUPS OR EXPLAIN THE VARIOUS PARTS OF A TOPIC. (SEE AN EXAMPLE.)
ILLUSTRATION: GIVE EXAMPLES AND EXPLAIN HOW THOSE EXAMPLES SUPPORT YOUR POINT. (SEE AN EXAMPLE IN THE 5-STEP PROCESS BELOW.)
ILLUSTRATION PARAGRAPH: A 5-STEP EXAMPLE
FROM THE LIST ABOVE, LET’S CHOOSE “ILLUSTRATION” AS OUR RHETORICAL PURPOSE. WE’LL WALK THROUGH A 5-STEP PROCESS FOR BUILDING A PARAGRAPH THAT ILLUSTRATES A POINT IN AN ARGUMENT. FOR EACH STEP THERE IS AN EXPLANATION AND EXAMPLE. OUR EXAMPLE PARAGRAPH WILL BE ABOUT HUMAN MISCONCEPTIONS OF PIRANHAS.

PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT CONTINUES WITH AN ELABORATION ON THE CONTROLLING IDEA, PERHAPS WITH AN EXPLANATION, IMPLICATION, OR STATEMENT ABOUT SIGNIFICANCE. OUR EXAMPLE OFFERS A POSSIBLE EXPLANATION FOR THE PERVASIVENESS OF THE MYTH.

ELABORATION — THIS IMPRESSION OF PIRANHAS IS EXACERBATED BY THEIR MISCHARACTERIZATION IN POPULAR MEDIA.

STEP 4. EXPLAIN THE EXAMPLE(S)
THE NEXT MOVEMENT IN PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT IS AN EXPLANATION OF EACH EXAMPLE AND ITS RELEVANCE TO THE TOPIC SENTENCE. THE EXPLANATION SHOULD DEMONSTRATE THE VALUE OF THE EXAMPLE AS EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE MAJOR CLAIM, OR FOCUS, IN YOUR PARAGRAPH.

CONTINUE THE PATTERN OF GIVING EXAMPLES AND EXPLAINING THEM UNTIL ALL POINTS/EXAMPLES THAT THE WRITER DEEMS NECESSARY HAVE BEEN MADE AND EXPLAINED. NONE OF YOUR EXAMPLES SHOULD BE LEFT UNEXPLAINED. YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE EXAMPLE AND THE TOPIC SENTENCE IN THE SAME SENTENCE WHICH INTRODUCED THE EXAMPLE. MORE OFTEN, HOWEVER, YOU WILL NEED TO EXPLAIN THAT RELATIONSHIP IN A SEPARATE SENTENCE.

EXPLANATION FOR EXAMPLE — SUCH A TERRIFYING REPRESENTATION EASILY CAPTURES THE IMAGINATION AND PROMOTES UNNECESSARY FEAR.

NOTICE THAT THE EXAMPLE AND EXPLANATION STEPS OF THIS 5-STEP PROCESS (STEPS 3 AND 4) CAN BE REPEATED AS NEEDED. THE IDEA IS THAT YOU CONTINUE TO USE THIS PATTERN UNTIL YOU HAVE COMPLETELY DEVELOPED THE MAIN IDEA OF THE PARAGRAPH.

STEP 5. COMPLETE THE PARAGRAPH’S IDEA OR TRANSITION INTO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH
THE FINAL MOVEMENT IN PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT INVOLVES TYING UP THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE PARAGRAPH. AT THIS POINT, YOU CAN REMIND YOUR READER ABOUT THE RELEVANCE OF THE INFORMATION TO THE LARGER PAPER, OR YOU CAN MAKE A CONCLUDING POINT FOR THIS EXAMPLE. YOU MIGHT, HOWEVER, SIMPLY TRANSITION TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH.

TROUBLESHOOTING PARAGRAPHS
PROBLEM: THE PARAGRAPH HAS NO TOPIC SENTENCE
IMAGINE EACH PARAGRAPH AS A SANDWICH. THE REAL CONTENT OF THE SANDWICH—THE MEAT OR OTHER FILLING—IS IN THE MIDDLE. IT INCLUDES ALL THE EVIDENCE YOU NEED TO MAKE THE POINT. BUT IT GETS KIND OF MESSY TO EAT A SANDWICH WITHOUT ANY BREAD. YOUR READERS DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH ALL THE EVIDENCE YOU’VE GIVEN THEM. SO, THE TOP SLICE OF BREAD (THE FIRST SENTENCE OF THE PARAGRAPH) EXPLAINS THE TOPIC (OR CONTROLLING IDEA) OF THE PARAGRAPH. AND, THE BOTTOM SLICE (THE LAST SENTENCE OF THE PARAGRAPH) TELLS THE READER HOW THE PARAGRAPH RELATES TO THE BROADER ARGUMENT. IN THE ORIGINAL AND REVISED PARAGRAPHS BELOW, NOTICE HOW A TOPIC SENTENCE EXPRESSING THE CONTROLLING IDEA TELLS THE READER THE POINT OF ALL THE EVIDENCE.

ORIGINAL PARAGRAPH

PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ FIRST INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. THEIR FEAR OF HUMANS MAKES SENSE. FAR MORE PIRANHAS ARE EATEN BY PEOPLE THAN PEOPLE ARE EATEN BY PIRANHAS. IF THE FISH ARE WELL-FED, THEY WON’T BITE HUMANS.

REVISED PARAGRAPH

ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER PIRANHAS TO BE QUITE DANGEROUS, THEY ARE, FOR THE MOST PART, ENTIRELY HARMLESS. PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ FIRST INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. THEIR FEAR OF HUMANS MAKES SENSE. FAR MORE PIRANHAS ARE EATEN BY PEOPLE THAN PEOPLE ARE EATEN BY PIRANHAS. IF THE FISH ARE WELL-FED, THEY WON’T BITE HUMANS.

ONCE YOU HAVE MASTERED THE USE OF TOPIC SENTENCES, YOU MAY DECIDE THAT THE TOPIC SENTENCE FOR A PARTICULAR PARAGRAPH REALLY SHOULDN’T BE THE FIRST SENTENCE OF THE PARAGRAPH. THIS IS FINE—THE TOPIC SENTENCE CAN ACTUALLY GO AT THE BEGINNING, MIDDLE, OR END OF A PARAGRAPH; WHAT’S IMPORTANT IS THAT IT IS IN THERE SOMEWHERE SO THAT READERS KNOW WHAT THE MAIN IDEA OF THE PARAGRAPH IS AND HOW IT RELATES BACK TO THE THESIS OF YOUR PAPER. SUPPOSE THAT WE WANTED TO START THE PIRANHA PARAGRAPH WITH A TRANSITION SENTENCE—SOMETHING THAT REMINDS THE READER OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH—RATHER THAN WITH THE TOPIC SENTENCE. LET’S SUPPOSE THAT THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH WAS ABOUT ALL KINDS OF ANIMALS THAT PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF, LIKE SHARKS, SNAKES, AND SPIDERS. OUR PARAGRAPH MIGHT LOOK LIKE THIS (THE TOPIC SENTENCE IS BOLD):

LIKE SHARKS, SNAKES, AND SPIDERS, PIRANHAS ARE WIDELY FEARED. ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER PIRANHAS TO BE QUITE DANGEROUS, THEY ARE, FOR THE MOST PART, ENTIRELY HARMLESS. PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ FIRST INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. THEIR FEAR OF HUMANS MAKES SENSE. FAR MORE PIRANHAS ARE EATEN BY PEOPLE THAN PEOPLE ARE EATEN BY PIRANHAS. IF THE FISH ARE WELL-FED, THEY WON’T BITE HUMANS.

PROBLEM: THE PARAGRAPH HAS MORE THAN ONE CONTROLLING IDEA
IF A PARAGRAPH HAS MORE THAN ONE MAIN IDEA, CONSIDER ELIMINATING SENTENCES THAT RELATE TO THE SECOND IDEA, OR SPLIT THE PARAGRAPH INTO TWO OR MORE PARAGRAPHS, EACH WITH ONLY ONE MAIN IDEA. WATCH OUR SHORT VIDEO ON REVERSE OUTLINING TO LEARN A QUICK WAY TO TEST WHETHER YOUR PARAGRAPHS ARE UNIFIED. IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH, THE FINAL TWO SENTENCES BRANCH OFF INTO A DIFFERENT TOPIC; SO, THE REVISED PARAGRAPH ELIMINATES THEM AND CONCLUDES WITH A SENTENCE THAT REMINDS THE READER OF THE PARAGRAPH’S MAIN IDEA.

ORIGINAL PARAGRAPH

ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER PIRANHAS TO BE QUITE DANGEROUS, THEY ARE, FOR THE MOST PART, ENTIRELY HARMLESS. PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ FIRST INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. THEIR FEAR OF HUMANS MAKES SENSE. FAR MORE PIRANHAS ARE EATEN BY PEOPLE THAN PEOPLE ARE EATEN BY PIRANHAS. A NUMBER OF SOUTH AMERICAN GROUPS EAT PIRANHAS. THEY FRY OR GRILL THE FISH AND THEN SERVE THEM WITH COCONUT MILK OR TUCUPI, A SAUCE MADE FROM FERMENTED MANIOC JUICES.

REVISED PARAGRAPH

ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER PIRANHAS TO BE QUITE DANGEROUS, THEY ARE, FOR THE MOST PART, ENTIRELY HARMLESS. PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ FIRST INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. THEIR FEAR OF HUMANS MAKES SENSE. FAR MORE PIRANHAS ARE EATEN BY PEOPLE THAN PEOPLE ARE EATEN BY PIRANHAS. IF THE FISH ARE WELL-FED, THEY WON’T BITE HUMANS.

PROBLEM: TRANSITIONS ARE NEEDED WITHIN THE PARAGRAPH
YOU ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH THE IDEA THAT TRANSITIONS MAY BE NEEDED BETWEEN PARAGRAPHS OR SECTIONS IN A PAPER (SEE OUR HANDOUT ON TRANSITIONS). SOMETIMES THEY ARE ALSO HELPFUL WITHIN THE BODY OF A SINGLE PARAGRAPH. WITHIN A PARAGRAPH, TRANSITIONS ARE OFTEN SINGLE WORDS OR SHORT PHRASES THAT HELP TO ESTABLISH RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN IDEAS AND TO CREATE A LOGICAL PROGRESSION OF THOSE IDEAS IN A PARAGRAPH. THIS IS ESPECIALLY LIKELY TO BE TRUE WITHIN PARAGRAPHS THAT DISCUSS MULTIPLE EXAMPLES. LET’S TAKE A LOOK AT A VERSION OF OUR PIRANHA PARAGRAPH THAT USES TRANSITIONS TO ORIENT THE READER:

ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER PIRANHAS TO BE QUITE DANGEROUS, THEY ARE, EXCEPT IN TWO MAIN SITUATIONS, ENTIRELY HARMLESS. PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. BUT THERE ARE TWO SITUATIONS IN WHICH A PIRANHA BITE IS LIKELY. THE FIRST IS WHEN A FRIGHTENED PIRANHA IS LIFTED OUT OF THE WATER—FOR EXAMPLE, IF IT HAS BEEN CAUGHT IN A FISHING NET. THE SECOND IS WHEN THE WATER LEVEL IN POOLS WHERE PIRANHAS ARE LIVING FALLS TOO LOW. A LARGE NUMBER OF FISH MAY BE TRAPPED IN A SINGLE POOL, AND IF THEY ARE HUNGRY, THEY MAY ATTACK ANYTHING THAT ENTERS THE WATER.

IN THIS EXAMPLE, YOU CAN SEE HOW THE PHRASES “THE FIRST” AND “THE SECOND” HELP THE READER FOLLOW THE ORGANIZATION OF THE IDEAS IN THE PARAGRAPH.

BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY IS AN ADVANCED DATABASE MECHANISM THAT ALLOWS TRANSPARENT INFORMATION SHARING WITHIN A BUSINESS 
NETWORK. A BLOCKCHAIN DATABASE STORES DATA IN BLOCKS THAT ARE LINKED TOGETHER IN A CHAIN. THE DATA IS CHRONOLOGICALLY 
CONSISTENT BECAUSE YOU CANNOT DELETE OR MODIFY THE CHAIN WITHOUT CONSENSUS FROM THE NETWORK. AS A RESULT, YOU CAN USE
 BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE AN UNALTERABLE OR IMMUTABLE LEDGER FOR TRACKING ORDERS, PAYMENTS, ACCOUNTS, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS. THE SYSTEM HAS BUILT-IN MECHANISMS THAT PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTION ENTRIES AND CREATE CONSISTENCY IN THE SHARED VIEW OF THESE TRANSACTIONS.
TRADITIONAL DATABASE TECHNOLOGIES PRESENT SEVERAL CHALLENGES FOR RECORDING FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS. FOR INSTANCE, CONSIDER THE SALE OF A PROPERTY. ONCE THE MONEY IS EXCHANGED, OWNERSHIP OF THE PROPERTY IS TRANSFERRED TO THE BUYER. INDIVIDUALLY, BOTH THE BUYER AND THE SELLER CAN RECORD THE MONETARY TRANSACTIONS, BUT NEITHER SOURCE CAN BE TRUSTED. THE SELLER CAN EASILY CLAIM THEY HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE MONEY EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE, AND THE BUYER CAN EQUALLY ARGUE THAT THEY HAVE PAID THE MONEY EVEN IF THEY HAVEN’T.

TO AVOID POTENTIAL LEGAL ISSUES, A TRUSTED THIRD PARTY HAS TO SUPERVISE AND VALIDATE TRANSACTIONS. THE PRESENCE OF THIS CENTRAL AUTHORITY NOT ONLY COMPLICATES THE TRANSACTION BUT ALSO CREATES A SINGLE POINT OF VULNERABILITY. IF THE CENTRAL DATABASE WAS COMPROMISED, BOTH PARTIES COULD SUFFER.

BLOCKCHAIN MITIGATES SUCH ISSUES BY CREATING A DECENTRALIZED, TAMPER-PROOF SYSTEM TO RECORD TRANSACTIONS. IN THE PROPERTY TRANSACTION SCENARIO, BLOCKCHAIN CREATES ONE LEDGER EACH FOR THE BUYER AND THE SELLER. ALL TRANSACTIONS MUST BE APPROVED BY BOTH PARTIES AND ARE AUTOMATICALLY UPDATED IN BOTH OF THEIR LEDGERS IN REAL TIME. ANY CORRUPTION IN HISTORICAL TRANSACTIONS WILL CORRUPT THE ENTIRE LEDGER. THESE PROPERTIES OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY HAVE LED TO ITS USE IN VARIOUS SECTORS, INCLUDING THE CREATION OF DIGITAL CURRENCY LIKE BITCOIN.
HOW DO DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES USE BLOCKCHAIN?
BLOCKCHAIN IS AN EMERGING TECHNOLOGY THAT IS BEING ADOPTED IN INNOVATIVE MANNER BY VARIOUS INDUSTRIES. WE DESCRIBE SOME USE CASES IN DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES IN THE FOLLOWING SUBSECTIONS:


ENERGY
ENERGY COMPANIES USE BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE PEER-TO-PEER ENERGY TRADING PLATFORMS AND STREAMLINE ACCESS TO RENEWABLE ENERGY. FOR EXAMPLE, CONSIDER THESE USES:

BLOCKCHAIN-BASED ENERGY COMPANIES HAVE CREATED A TRADING PLATFORM FOR THE SALE OF ELECTRICITY BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS. HOMEOWNERS WITH SOLAR PANELS USE THIS PLATFORM TO SELL THEIR EXCESS SOLAR ENERGY TO NEIGHBORS. THE PROCESS IS LARGELY AUTOMATED: SMART METERS CREATE TRANSACTIONS, AND BLOCKCHAIN RECORDS THEM.
WITH BLOCKCHAIN-BASED CROWD FUNDING INITIATIVES, USERS CAN SPONSOR AND OWN SOLAR PANELS IN COMMUNITIES THAT LACK ENERGY ACCESS. SPONSORS MIGHT ALSO RECEIVE RENT FOR THESE COMMUNITIES ONCE THE SOLAR PANELS ARE CONSTRUCTED.
FINANCE
TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL SYSTEMS, LIKE BANKS AND STOCK EXCHANGES, USE BLOCKCHAIN SERVICES TO MANAGE ONLINE PAYMENTS, ACCOUNTS, AND MARKET TRADING. FOR EXAMPLE, SINGAPORE EXCHANGE LIMITED, AN INVESTMENT HOLDING COMPANY THAT PROVIDES FINANCIAL TRADING SERVICES THROUGHOUT ASIA, USES BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY TO BUILD A MORE EFFICIENT INTERBANK PAYMENT ACCOUNT. BY ADOPTING BLOCKCHAIN, THEY SOLVED SEVERAL CHALLENGES, INCLUDING BATCH PROCESSING AND MANUAL RECONCILIATION OF SEVERAL THOUSAND FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS.

MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT
COMPANIES IN MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT USE BLOCKCHAIN SYSTEMS TO MANAGE COPYRIGHT DATA. COPYRIGHT VERIFICATION IS CRITICAL FOR THE FAIR COMPENSATION OF ARTISTS. IT TAKES MULTIPLE TRANSACTIONS TO RECORD THE SALE OR TRANSFER OF COPYRIGHT CONTENT. SONY MUSIC ENTERTAINMENT JAPAN USES BLOCKCHAIN SERVICES TO MAKE DIGITAL RIGHTS MANAGEMENT MORE EFFICIENT. THEY HAVE SUCCESSFULLY USED BLOCKCHAIN STRATEGY TO IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY AND REDUCE COSTS IN COPYRIGHT PROCESSING.

RETAIL
RETAIL COMPANIES USE BLOCKCHAIN TO TRACK THE MOVEMENT OF GOODS BETWEEN SUPPLIERS AND BUYERS. FOR EXAMPLE, AMAZON RETAIL HAS FILED A PATENT FOR A DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM THAT WILL USE BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY TO VERIFY THAT ALL GOODS SOLD ON THE PLATFORM ARE AUTHENTIC. AMAZON SELLERS CAN MAP THEIR GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS BY ALLOWING PARTICIPANTS SUCH AS MANUFACTURERS, COURIERS, DISTRIBUTORS, END USERS, AND SECONDARY USERS TO ADD EVENTS TO THE LEDGER AFTER REGISTERING WITH A CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY. 

WHAT ARE THE FEATURES OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY?
BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY HAS THE FOLLOWING MAIN FEATURES:

DECENTRALIZATION
DECENTRALIZATION IN BLOCKCHAIN REFERS TO TRANSFERRING CONTROL AND DECISION MAKING FROM A CENTRALIZED ENTITY (INDIVIDUAL, ORGANIZATION, OR GROUP) TO A DISTRIBUTED NETWORK. DECENTRALIZED BLOCKCHAIN NETWORKS USE TRANSPARENCY TO REDUCE THE NEED FOR TRUST AMONG PARTICIPANTS. THESE NETWORKS ALSO DETER PARTICIPANTS FROM EXERTING AUTHORITY OR CONTROL OVER ONE ANOTHER IN WAYS THAT DEGRADE THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE NETWORK.

IMMUTABILITY
IMMUTABILITY MEANS SOMETHING CANNOT BE CHANGED OR ALTERED. NO PARTICIPANT CAN TAMPER WITH A TRANSACTION ONCE SOMEONE HAS RECORDED IT TO THE SHARED LEDGER. IF A TRANSACTION RECORD INCLUDES AN ERROR, YOU MUST ADD A NEW TRANSACTION TO REVERSE THE MISTAKE, AND BOTH TRANSACTIONS ARE VISIBLE TO THE NETWORK.

CONSENSUS
A BLOCKCHAIN SYSTEM ESTABLISHES RULES ABOUT PARTICIPANT CONSENT FOR RECORDING TRANSACTIONS. YOU CAN RECORD NEW TRANSACTIONS ONLY WHEN THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE NETWORK GIVE THEIR CONSENT.

WHAT ARE THE KEY COMPONENTS OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY?
BLOCKCHAIN ARCHITECTURE HAS THE FOLLOWING MAIN COMPONENTS:

A DISTRIBUTED LEDGER

A DISTRIBUTED LEDGER IS THE SHARED DATABASE IN THE BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK THAT STORES THE TRANSACTIONS, SUCH AS A SHARED FILE THAT EVERYONE IN THE TEAM CAN EDIT. IN MOST SHARED TEXT EDITORS, ANYONE WITH EDITING RIGHTS CAN DELETE THE ENTIRE FILE. HOWEVER, DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGIES HAVE STRICT RULES ABOUT WHO CAN EDIT AND HOW TO EDIT. YOU CANNOT DELETE ENTRIES ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN RECORDED.

SMART CONTRACTS
COMPANIES USE SMART CONTRACTS TO SELF-MANAGE BUSINESS CONTRACTS WITHOUT THE NEED FOR AN ASSISTING THIRD PARTY. THEY ARE PROGRAMS STORED ON THE BLOCKCHAIN SYSTEM THAT RUN AUTOMATICALLY WHEN PREDETERMINED CONDITIONS ARE MET. THEY RUN IF-THEN CHECKS SO THAT TRANSACTIONS CAN BE COMPLETED CONFIDENTLY. FOR EXAMPLE, A LOGISTICS COMPANY CAN HAVE A SMART CONTRACT THAT AUTOMATICALLY MAKES PAYMENT ONCE GOODS HAVE ARRIVED AT THE PORT.

PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY
PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY IS A SECURITY FEATURE TO UNIQUELY IDENTIFY PARTICIPANTS IN THE BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK. THIS MECHANISM GENERATES TWO SETS OF KEYS FOR NETWORK MEMBERS. ONE KEY IS A PUBLIC KEY THAT IS COMMON TO EVERYONE IN THE NETWORK. THE OTHER IS A PRIVATE KEY THAT IS UNIQUE TO EVERY MEMBER. THE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC KEYS WORK TOGETHER TO UNLOCK THE DATA IN THE LEDGER. 

FOR EXAMPLE, JOHN AND JILL ARE TWO MEMBERS OF THE NETWORK. JOHN RECORDS A TRANSACTION THAT IS ENCRYPTED WITH HIS PRIVATE KEY. JILL CAN DECRYPT IT WITH HER PUBLIC KEY. THIS WAY, JILL IS CONFIDENT THAT JOHN MADE THE TRANSACTION. JILL'S PUBLIC KEY WOULDN'T HAVE WORKED IF JOHN'S PRIVATE KEY HAD BEEN TAMPERED WITH.

HOW DOES BLOCKCHAIN WORK?
WHILE UNDERLYING BLOCKCHAIN MECHANISMS ARE COMPLEX, WE GIVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW IN THE FOLLOWING STEPS. BLOCKCHAIN SOFTWARE CAN AUTOMATE MOST OF THESE STEPS:

STEP 1 – RECORD THE TRANSACTION
A BLOCKCHAIN TRANSACTION SHOWS THE MOVEMENT OF PHYSICAL OR DIGITAL ASSETS FROM ONE PARTY TO ANOTHER IN THE BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK. IT IS RECORDED AS A DATA BLOCK AND CAN INCLUDE DETAILS LIKE THESE:

WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THE TRANSACTION?
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE TRANSACTION?
WHEN DID THE TRANSACTION OCCUR?
WHERE DID THE TRANSACTION OCCUR?
WHY DID THE TRANSACTION OCCUR?
HOW MUCH OF THE ASSET WAS EXCHANGED?
HOW MANY PRE-CONDITIONS WERE MET DURING THE TRANSACTION?
STEP 2 – GAIN CONSENSUS

PARAGRAPHS
WHAT THIS HANDOUT IS ABOUT
THIS HANDOUT WILL HELP YOU UNDERSTAND HOW PARAGRAPHS ARE FORMED, HOW TO DEVELOP STRONGER PARAGRAPHS, AND HOW TO COMPLETELY AND CLEARLY EXPRESS YOUR IDEAS.

WHAT IS A PARAGRAPH?
PARAGRAPHS ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF PAPERS. MANY STUDENTS DEFINE PARAGRAPHS IN TERMS OF LENGTH: A PARAGRAPH IS A GROUP OF AT LEAST FIVE SENTENCES, A PARAGRAPH IS HALF A PAGE LONG, ETC. IN REALITY, THOUGH, THE UNITY AND COHERENCE OF IDEAS AMONG SENTENCES IS WHAT CONSTITUTES A PARAGRAPH. A PARAGRAPH IS DEFINED AS “A GROUP OF SENTENCES OR A SINGLE SENTENCE THAT FORMS A UNIT” (LUNSFORD AND CONNORS 116). LENGTH AND APPEARANCE DO NOT DETERMINE WHETHER A SECTION IN A PAPER IS A PARAGRAPH. FOR INSTANCE, IN SOME STYLES OF WRITING, PARTICULARLY JOURNALISTIC STYLES, A PARAGRAPH CAN BE JUST ONE SENTENCE LONG. ULTIMATELY, A PARAGRAPH IS A SENTENCE OR GROUP OF SENTENCES THAT SUPPORT ONE MAIN IDEA. IN THIS HANDOUT, WE WILL REFER TO THIS AS THE “CONTROLLING IDEA,” BECAUSE IT CONTROLS WHAT HAPPENS IN THE REST OF THE PARAGRAPH.
HOW DO I DECIDE WHAT TO PUT IN A PARAGRAPH?
BEFORE YOU CAN BEGIN TO DETERMINE WHAT THE COMPOSITION OF A PARTICULAR PARAGRAPH WILL BE, YOU MUST FIRST DECIDE ON AN ARGUMENT AND A WORKING THESIS STATEMENT FOR YOUR PAPER. WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT IDEA THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO CONVEY TO YOUR READER? THE INFORMATION IN EACH PARAGRAPH MUST BE RELATED TO THAT IDEA. IN OTHER WORDS, YOUR PARAGRAPHS SHOULD REMIND YOUR READER THAT THERE IS A RECURRENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOUR THESIS AND THE INFORMATION IN EACH PARAGRAPH. A WORKING THESIS FUNCTIONS LIKE A SEED FROM WHICH YOUR PAPER, AND YOUR IDEAS, WILL GROW. THE WHOLE PROCESS IS AN ORGANIC ONE—A NATURAL PROGRESSION FROM A SEED TO A FULL-BLOWN PAPER WHERE THERE ARE DIRECT, FAMILIAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ALL OF THE IDEAS IN THE PAPER.

THE DECISION ABOUT WHAT TO PUT INTO YOUR PARAGRAPHS BEGINS WITH THE GERMINATION OF A SEED OF IDEAS; THIS “GERMINATION PROCESS” IS BETTER KNOWN AS BRAINSTORMING. THERE ARE MANY TECHNIQUES FOR BRAINSTORMING; WHICHEVER ONE YOU CHOOSE, THIS STAGE OF PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT CANNOT BE SKIPPED. BUILDING PARAGRAPHS CAN BE LIKE BUILDING A SKYSCRAPER: THERE MUST BE A WELL-PLANNED FOUNDATION THAT SUPPORTS WHAT YOU ARE BUILDING. ANY CRACKS, INCONSISTENCIES, OR OTHER CORRUPTIONS OF THE FOUNDATION CAN CAUSE YOUR WHOLE PAPER TO CRUMBLE.

SO, LET’S SUPPOSE THAT YOU HAVE DONE SOME BRAINSTORMING TO DEVELOP YOUR THESIS. WHAT ELSE SHOULD YOU KEEP IN MIND AS YOU BEGIN TO CREATE PARAGRAPHS? EVERY PARAGRAPH IN A PAPER SHOULD BE:

UNIFIED: ALL OF THE SENTENCES IN A SINGLE PARAGRAPH SHOULD BE RELATED TO A SINGLE CONTROLLING IDEA (OFTEN EXPRESSED IN THE TOPIC SENTENCE OF THE PARAGRAPH).
CLEARLY RELATED TO THE THESIS: THE SENTENCES SHOULD ALL REFER TO THE CENTRAL IDEA, OR THESIS, OF THE PAPER (ROSEN AND BEHRENS 119).
COHERENT: THE SENTENCES SHOULD BE ARRANGED IN A LOGICAL MANNER AND SHOULD FOLLOW A DEFINITE PLAN FOR DEVELOPMENT (ROSEN AND BEHRENS 119).
WELL-DEVELOPED: EVERY IDEA DISCUSSED IN THE PARAGRAPH SHOULD BE ADEQUATELY EXPLAINED AND SUPPORTED THROUGH EVIDENCE AND DETAILS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO EXPLAIN THE PARAGRAPH’S CONTROLLING IDEA (ROSEN AND BEHRENS 119).
HOW DO I ORGANIZE A PARAGRAPH?
THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS TO ORGANIZE A PARAGRAPH. THE ORGANIZATION YOU CHOOSE WILL DEPEND ON THE CONTROLLING IDEA OF THE PARAGRAPH. BELOW ARE A FEW POSSIBILITIES FOR ORGANIZATION, WITH LINKS TO BRIEF EXAMPLES:

NARRATION: TELL A STORY. GO CHRONOLOGICALLY, FROM START TO FINISH. (SEE AN EXAMPLE.)
DESCRIPTION: PROVIDE SPECIFIC DETAILS ABOUT WHAT SOMETHING LOOKS, SMELLS, TASTES, SOUNDS, OR FEELS LIKE. ORGANIZE SPATIALLY, IN ORDER OF APPEARANCE, OR BY TOPIC. (SEE AN EXAMPLE.)
PROCESS: EXPLAIN HOW SOMETHING WORKS, STEP BY STEP. PERHAPS FOLLOW A SEQUENCE—FIRST, SECOND, THIRD. (SEE AN EXAMPLE.)
CLASSIFICATION: SEPARATE INTO GROUPS OR EXPLAIN THE VARIOUS PARTS OF A TOPIC. (SEE AN EXAMPLE.)
ILLUSTRATION: GIVE EXAMPLES AND EXPLAIN HOW THOSE EXAMPLES SUPPORT YOUR POINT. (SEE AN EXAMPLE IN THE 5-STEP PROCESS BELOW.)
ILLUSTRATION PARAGRAPH: A 5-STEP EXAMPLE
FROM THE LIST ABOVE, LET’S CHOOSE “ILLUSTRATION” AS OUR RHETORICAL PURPOSE. WE’LL WALK THROUGH A 5-STEP PROCESS FOR BUILDING A PARAGRAPH THAT ILLUSTRATES A POINT IN AN ARGUMENT. FOR EACH STEP THERE IS AN EXPLANATION AND EXAMPLE. OUR EXAMPLE PARAGRAPH WILL BE ABOUT HUMAN MISCONCEPTIONS OF PIRANHAS.

STEP 1. DECIDE ON A CONTROLLING IDEA AND CREATE A TOPIC SENTENCE
PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT BEGINS WITH THE FORMULATION OF THE CONTROLLING IDEA. THIS IDEA DIRECTS THE PARAGRAPH’S DEVELOPMENT. OFTEN, THE CONTROLLING IDEA OF A PARAGRAPH WILL APPEAR IN THE FORM OF A TOPIC SENTENCE. IN SOME CASES, YOU MAY NEED MORE THAN ONE SENTENCE TO EXPRESS A PARAGRAPH’S CONTROLLING IDEA.

CONTROLLING IDEA AND TOPIC SENTENCE — DESPITE THE FACT THAT PIRANHAS ARE RELATIVELY HARMLESS, MANY PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THE PERVASIVE MYTH THAT PIRANHAS ARE DANGEROUS TO HUMANS.

STEP 2. ELABORATE ON THE CONTROLLING IDEA
PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT CONTINUES WITH AN ELABORATION ON THE CONTROLLING IDEA, PERHAPS WITH AN EXPLANATION, IMPLICATION, OR STATEMENT ABOUT SIGNIFICANCE. OUR EXAMPLE OFFERS A POSSIBLE EXPLANATION FOR THE PERVASIVENESS OF THE MYTH.

ELABORATION — THIS IMPRESSION OF PIRANHAS IS EXACERBATED BY THEIR MISCHARACTERIZATION IN POPULAR MEDIA.

STEP 3. GIVE AN EXAMPLE (OR MULTIPLE EXAMPLES)
PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT PROGRESSES WITH AN EXAMPLE (OR MORE) THAT ILLUSTRATES THE CLAIMS MADE IN THE PREVIOUS SENTENCES.

EXAMPLE — FOR EXAMPLE, THE PROMOTIONAL POSTER FOR THE 1978 HORROR FILM PIRANHA FEATURES AN OVERSIZED PIRANHA POISED TO BITE THE LEG OF AN UNSUSPECTING WOMAN.

STEP 4. EXPLAIN THE EXAMPLE(S)
THE NEXT MOVEMENT IN PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT IS AN EXPLANATION OF EACH EXAMPLE AND ITS RELEVANCE TO THE TOPIC SENTENCE. THE EXPLANATION SHOULD DEMONSTRATE THE VALUE OF THE EXAMPLE AS EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE MAJOR CLAIM, OR FOCUS, IN YOUR PARAGRAPH.

CONTINUE THE PATTERN OF GIVING EXAMPLES AND EXPLAINING THEM UNTIL ALL POINTS/EXAMPLES THAT THE WRITER DEEMS NECESSARY HAVE BEEN MADE AND EXPLAINED. NONE OF YOUR EXAMPLES SHOULD BE LEFT UNEXPLAINED. YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE EXAMPLE AND THE TOPIC SENTENCE IN THE SAME SENTENCE WHICH INTRODUCED THE EXAMPLE. MORE OFTEN, HOWEVER, YOU WILL NEED TO EXPLAIN THAT RELATIONSHIP IN A SEPARATE SENTENCE.

EXPLANATION FOR EXAMPLE — SUCH A TERRIFYING REPRESENTATION EASILY CAPTURES THE IMAGINATION AND PROMOTES UNNECESSARY FEAR.

NOTICE THAT THE EXAMPLE AND EXPLANATION STEPS OF THIS 5-STEP PROCESS (STEPS 3 AND 4) CAN BE REPEATED AS NEEDED. THE IDEA IS THAT YOU CONTINUE TO USE THIS PATTERN UNTIL YOU HAVE COMPLETELY DEVELOPED THE MAIN IDEA OF THE PARAGRAPH.

STEP 5. COMPLETE THE PARAGRAPH’S IDEA OR TRANSITION INTO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH
THE FINAL MOVEMENT IN PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT INVOLVES TYING UP THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE PARAGRAPH. AT THIS POINT, YOU CAN REMIND YOUR READER ABOUT THE RELEVANCE OF THE INFORMATION TO THE LARGER PAPER, OR YOU CAN MAKE A CONCLUDING POINT FOR THIS EXAMPLE. YOU MIGHT, HOWEVER, SIMPLY TRANSITION TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH.

SENTENCES FOR COMPLETING A PARAGRAPH — WHILE THE TROPE OF THE MAN-EATING PIRANHAS LENDS EXCITEMENT TO THE ADVENTURE STORIES, IT BEARS LITTLE RESEMBLANCE TO THE REAL-LIFE PIRANHA. BY PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO FACT THAN FICTION, HUMANS MAY FINALLY BE ABLE TO LET GO OF THIS INACCURATE BELIEF.

FINISHED PARAGRAPH
DESPITE THE FACT THAT PIRANHAS ARE RELATIVELY HARMLESS, MANY PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THE PERVASIVE MYTH THAT PIRANHAS ARE DANGEROUS TO HUMANS. THIS IMPRESSION OF PIRANHAS IS EXACERBATED BY THEIR MISCHARACTERIZATION IN POPULAR MEDIA. FOR EXAMPLE, THE PROMOTIONAL POSTER FOR THE 1978 HORROR FILM PIRANHA FEATURES AN OVERSIZED PIRANHA POISED TO BITE THE LEG OF AN UNSUSPECTING WOMAN. SUCH A TERRIFYING REPRESENTATION EASILY CAPTURES THE IMAGINATION AND PROMOTES UNNECESSARY FEAR. WHILE THE TROPE OF THE MAN-EATING PIRANHAS LENDS EXCITEMENT TO THE ADVENTURE STORIES, IT BEARS LITTLE RESEMBLANCE TO THE REAL-LIFE PIRANHA. BY PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO FACT THAN FICTION, HUMANS MAY FINALLY BE ABLE TO LET GO OF THIS INACCURATE BELIEF.

TROUBLESHOOTING PARAGRAPHS
PROBLEM: THE PARAGRAPH HAS NO TOPIC SENTENCE
IMAGINE EACH PARAGRAPH AS A SANDWICH. THE REAL CONTENT OF THE SANDWICH—THE MEAT OR OTHER FILLING—IS IN THE MIDDLE. IT INCLUDES ALL THE EVIDENCE YOU NEED TO MAKE THE POINT. BUT IT GETS KIND OF MESSY TO EAT A SANDWICH WITHOUT ANY BREAD. YOUR READERS DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH ALL THE EVIDENCE YOU’VE GIVEN THEM. SO, THE TOP SLICE OF BREAD (THE FIRST SENTENCE OF THE PARAGRAPH) EXPLAINS THE TOPIC (OR CONTROLLING IDEA) OF THE PARAGRAPH. AND, THE BOTTOM SLICE (THE LAST SENTENCE OF THE PARAGRAPH) TELLS THE READER HOW THE PARAGRAPH RELATES TO THE BROADER ARGUMENT. IN THE ORIGINAL AND REVISED PARAGRAPHS BELOW, NOTICE HOW A TOPIC SENTENCE EXPRESSING THE CONTROLLING IDEA TELLS THE READER THE POINT OF ALL THE EVIDENCE.

ORIGINAL PARAGRAPH

PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ FIRST INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. THEIR FEAR OF HUMANS MAKES SENSE.

ONCE YOU HAVE MASTERED THE USE OF TOPIC SENTENCES, YOU MAY DECIDE THAT THE TOPIC SENTENCE FOR A PARTICULAR PARAGRAPH REALLY SHOULDN’T BE THE FIRST SENTENCE OF THE PARAGRAPH. THIS IS FINE—THE TOPIC SENTENCE CAN ACTUALLY GO AT THE BEGINNING, MIDDLE, OR END OF A PARAGRAPH; WHAT’S IMPORTANT IS THAT IT IS IN THERE SOMEWHERE SO THAT READERS KNOW WHAT THE MAIN IDEA OF THE PARAGRAPH IS AND HOW IT RELATES BACK TO THE THESIS OF YOUR PAPER. SUPPOSE THAT WE WANTED TO START THE PIRANHA PARAGRAPH WITH A TRANSITION SENTENCE—SOMETHING THAT REMINDS THE READER OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH—RATHER THAN WITH THE TOPIC SENTENCE. LET’S SUPPOSE THAT THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH WAS ABOUT ALL KINDS OF ANIMALS THAT PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF, LIKE SHARKS, SNAKES, AND SPIDERS. OUR PARAGRAPH MIGHT LOOK LIKE THIS (THE TOPIC SENTENCE IS BOLD):

IF A PARAGRAPH HAS MORE THAN ONE MAIN IDEA, CONSIDER ELIMINATING SENTENCES THAT RELATE TO THE SECOND IDEA, OR SPLIT THE PARAGRAPH INTO TWO OR MORE PARAGRAPHS, EACH WITH ONLY ONE MAIN IDEA. WATCH OUR SHORT VIDEO ON REVERSE OUTLINING TO LEARN A QUICK WAY TO TEST WHETHER YOUR PARAGRAPHS ARE UNIFIED. IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH, THE FINAL TWO SENTENCES BRANCH OFF INTO A DIFFERENT TOPIC; SO, THE REVISED PARAGRAPH ELIMINATES THEM AND CONCLUDES WITH A SENTENCE THAT REMINDS THE READER OF THE PARAGRAPH’S MAIN IDEA.

PROBLEM: TRANSITIONS ARE NEEDED WITHIN THE PARAGRAPH
YOU ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH THE IDEA THAT TRANSITIONS MAY BE NEEDED BETWEEN PARAGRAPHS OR SECTIONS IN A PAPER (SEE OUR HANDOUT ON TRANSITIONS). SOMETIMES THEY ARE ALSO HELPFUL WITHIN THE BODY OF A SINGLE PARAGRAPH. WITHIN A PARAGRAPH, TRANSITIONS ARE OFTEN SINGLE WORDS OR SHORT PHRASES THAT HELP TO ESTABLISH RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN IDEAS AND TO CREATE A LOGICAL PROGRESSION OF THOSE IDEAS IN A PARAGRAPH. THIS IS ESPECIALLY LIKELY TO BE TRUE WITHIN PARAGRAPHS THAT DISCUSS MULTIPLE EXAMPLES. LET’S TAKE A LOOK AT A VERSION OF OUR PIRANHA PARAGRAPH THAT USES TRANSITIONS TO ORIENT THE READER:

THE SECOND IS WHEN THE WATER LEVEL IN POOLS WHERE PIRANHAS ARE LIVING FALLS TOO LOW. A LARGE NUMBER OF FISH MAY BE TRAPPED IN A SINGLE POOL, AND IF THEY ARE HUNGRY, THEY MAY ATTACK ANYTHING THAT ENTERS THE WATER.

IN THIS EXAMPLE, YOU CAN SEE HOW THE PHRASES “THE FIRST” AND “THE SECOND” HELP THE READER FOLLOW THE ORGANIZATION OF THE IDEAS IN THE PARAGRAPH.

CONSISTENT BECAUSE YOU CANNOT DELETE OR MODIFY THE CHAIN WITHOUT CONSENSUS FROM THE NETWORK. AS A RESULT, YOU CAN USE
 BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE AN UNALTERABLE OR IMMUTABLE LEDGER FOR TRACKING ORDERS, PAYMENTS, ACCOUNTS, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS. THE SYSTEM HAS BUILT-IN MECHANISMS THAT PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTION ENTRIES AND CREATE CONSISTENCY IN THE SHARED VIEW OF THESE TRANSACTIONS.
TRADITIONAL DATABASE TECHNOLOGIES PRESENT SEVERAL CHALLENGES FOR RECORDING FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS. FOR INSTANCE, CONSIDER THE SALE OF A PROPERTY. ONCE THE MONEY IS EXCHANGED, OWNERSHIP OF THE PROPERTY IS TRANSFERRED TO THE BUYER. INDIVIDUALLY, BOTH THE BUYER AND THE SELLER CAN RECORD THE MONETARY TRANSACTIONS, BUT NEITHER SOURCE CAN BE TRUSTED. THE SELLER CAN EASILY CLAIM THEY HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE MONEY EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE, AND THE BUYER CAN EQUALLY ARGUE THAT THEY HAVE PAID THE MONEY EVEN IF THEY HAVEN’T.

TO AVOID POTENTIAL LEGAL ISSUES, A TRUSTED THIRD PARTY HAS TO SUPERVISE AND VALIDATE TRANSACTIONS. THE PRESENCE OF THIS CENTRAL AUTHORITY NOT ONLY COMPLICATES THE TRANSACTION BUT ALSO CREATES A SINGLE POINT OF VULNERABILITY. IF THE CENTRAL DATABASE WAS COMPROMISED, BOTH PARTIES COULD SUFFER.

BLOCKCHAIN MITIGATES SUCH ISSUES BY CREATING A DECENTRALIZED, TAMPER-PROOF SYSTEM TO RECORD TRANSACTIONS. IN THE PROPERTY TRANSACTION SCENARIO, BLOCKCHAIN CREATES ONE LEDGER EACH FOR THE BUYER AND THE SELLER. ALL TRANSACTIONS MUST BE APPROVED BY BOTH PARTIES AND ARE AUTOMATICALLY UPDATED IN BOTH OF THEIR LEDGERS IN REAL TIME. ANY CORRUPTION IN HISTORICAL TRANSACTIONS WILL CORRUPT THE ENTIRE LEDGER. THESE PROPERTIES OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY HAVE LED TO ITS USE IN VARIOUS SECTORS, INCLUDING THE CREATION OF DIGITAL CURRENCY LIKE BITCOIN.
HOW DO DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES USE BLOCKCHAIN?
BLOCKCHAIN IS AN EMERGING TECHNOLOGY THAT IS BEING ADOPTED IN INNOVATIVE MANNER BY VARIOUS INDUSTRIES. WE DESCRIBE SOME USE CASES IN DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES IN THE FOLLOWING SUBSECTIONS:


ENERGY
ENERGY COMPANIES USE BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE PEER-TO-PEER ENERGY TRADING PLATFORMS AND STREAMLINE ACCESS TO RENEWABLE ENERGY. FOR EXAMPLE, CONSIDER THESE USES:

BLOCKCHAIN-BASED ENERGY COMPANIES HAVE CREATED A TRADING PLATFORM FOR THE SALE OF ELECTRICITY BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS. HOMEOWNERS WITH SOLAR PANELS USE THIS PLATFORM TO SELL THEIR EXCESS SOLAR ENERGY TO NEIGHBORS. THE PROCESS IS LARGELY AUTOMATED: SMART METERS CREATE TRANSACTIONS, AND BLOCKCHAIN RECORDS THEM.
WITH BLOCKCHAIN-BASED CROWD FUNDING INITIATIVES, USERS CAN SPONSOR AND OWN SOLAR PANELS IN COMMUNITIES THAT LACK ENERGY ACCESS. SPONSORS MIGHT ALSO RECEIVE RENT FOR THESE COMMUNITIES ONCE THE SOLAR PANELS ARE CONSTRUCTED.
FINANCE
TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL SYSTEMS, LIKE BANKS AND STOCK EXCHANGES, USE BLOCKCHAIN SERVICES TO MANAGE ONLINE PAYMENTS, ACCOUNTS, AND MARKET TRADING. FOR EXAMPLE, SINGAPORE EXCHANGE LIMITED, AN INVESTMENT HOLDING COMPANY THAT PROVIDES FINANCIAL TRADING SERVICES THROUGHOUT ASIA, USES BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY TO BUILD A MORE EFFICIENT INTERBANK PAYMENT ACCOUNT. BY ADOPTING BLOCKCHAIN, THEY SOLVED SEVERAL CHALLENGES, INCLUDING BATCH PROCESSING AND MANUAL RECONCILIATION OF SEVERAL THOUSAND FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS.

MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT
COMPANIES IN MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT USE BLOCKCHAIN SYSTEMS TO MANAGE COPYRIGHT DATA. COPYRIGHT VERIFICATION IS CRITICAL FOR THE FAIR COMPENSATION OF ARTISTS. IT TAKES MULTIPLE TRANSACTIONS TO RECORD THE SALE OR TRANSFER OF COPYRIGHT CONTENT. SONY MUSIC ENTERTAINMENT JAPAN USES BLOCKCHAIN SERVICES TO MAKE DIGITAL RIGHTS MANAGEMENT MORE EFFICIENT. THEY HAVE SUCCESSFULLY USED BLOCKCHAIN STRATEGY TO IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY AND REDUCE COSTS IN COPYRIGHT PROCESSING.

RETAIL
RETAIL COMPANIES USE BLOCKCHAIN TO TRACK THE MOVEMENT OF GOODS BETWEEN SUPPLIERS AND BUYERS. FOR EXAMPLE, AMAZON RETAIL HAS FILED A PATENT FOR A DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM THAT WILL USE BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY TO VERIFY THAT ALL GOODS SOLD ON THE PLATFORM ARE AUTHENTIC. AMAZON SELLERS CAN MAP THEIR GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS BY ALLOWING PARTICIPANTS SUCH AS MANUFACTURERS, COURIERS, DISTRIBUTORS, END USERS, AND SECONDARY USERS TO ADD EVENTS TO THE LEDGER AFTER REGISTERING WITH A CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY. 

WHAT ARE THE FEATURES OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY?
BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY HAS THE FOLLOWING MAIN FEATURES:

DECENTRALIZATION
DECENTRALIZATION IN BLOCKCHAIN REFERS TO TRANSFERRING CONTROL AND DECISION MAKING FROM A CENTRALIZED ENTITY (INDIVIDUAL, ORGANIZATION, OR GROUP) TO A DISTRIBUTED NETWORK. DECENTRALIZED BLOCKCHAIN NETWORKS USE TRANSPARENCY TO REDUCE THE NEED FOR TRUST AMONG PARTICIPANTS. THESE NETWORKS ALSO DETER PARTICIPANTS FROM EXERTING AUTHORITY OR CONTROL OVER ONE ANOTHER IN WAYS THAT DEGRADE THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE NETWORK.

IMMUTABILITY
IMMUTABILITY MEANS SOMETHING CANNOT BE CHANGED OR ALTERED. NO PARTICIPANT CAN TAMPER WITH A TRANSACTION ONCE SOMEONE HAS RECORDED IT TO THE SHARED LEDGER. IF A TRANSACTION RECORD INCLUDES AN ERROR, YOU MUST ADD A NEW TRANSACTION TO REVERSE THE MISTAKE, AND BOTH TRANSACTIONS ARE VISIBLE TO THE NETWORK.

CONSENSUS
A BLOCKCHAIN SYSTEM ESTABLISHES RULES ABOUT PARTICIPANT CONSENT FOR RECORDING TRANSACTIONS. YOU CAN RECORD NEW TRANSACTIONS ONLY WHEN THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE NETWORK GIVE THEIR CONSENT.

WHAT ARE THE KEY COMPONENTS OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY?
BLOCKCHAIN ARCHITECTURE HAS THE FOLLOWING MAIN COMPONENTS:

A DISTRIBUTED LEDGER

A DISTRIBUTED LEDGER IS THE SHARED DATABASE IN THE BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK THAT STORES THE TRANSACTIONS, SUCH AS A SHARED FILE THAT EVERYONE IN THE TEAM CAN EDIT. IN MOST SHARED TEXT EDITORS, ANYONE WITH EDITING RIGHTS CAN DELETE THE ENTIRE FILE. HOWEVER, DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGIES HAVE STRICT RULES ABOUT WHO CAN EDIT AND HOW TO EDIT. YOU CANNOT DELETE ENTRIES ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN RECORDED.

SMART CONTRACTS
COMPANIES USE SMART CONTRACTS TO SELF-MANAGE BUSINESS CONTRACTS WITHOUT THE NEED FOR AN ASSISTING THIRD PARTY. THEY ARE PROGRAMS STORED ON THE BLOCKCHAIN SYSTEM THAT RUN AUTOMATICALLY WHEN PREDETERMINED CONDITIONS ARE MET. THEY RUN IF-THEN CHECKS SO THAT TRANSACTIONS CAN BE COMPLETED CONFIDENTLY. FOR EXAMPLE, A LOGISTICS COMPANY CAN HAVE A SMART CONTRACT THAT AUTOMATICALLY MAKES PAYMENT ONCE GOODS HAVE ARRIVED AT THE PORT.

PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY
PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY IS A SECURITY FEATURE TO UNIQUELY IDENTIFY PARTICIPANTS IN THE BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK. THIS MECHANISM GENERATES TWO SETS OF KEYS FOR NETWORK MEMBERS. ONE KEY IS A PUBLIC KEY THAT IS COMMON TO EVERYONE IN THE NETWORK. THE OTHER IS A PRIVATE KEY THAT IS UNIQUE TO EVERY MEMBER. THE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC KEYS WORK TOGETHER TO UNLOCK THE DATA IN THE LEDGER. 

FOR EXAMPLE, JOHN AND JILL ARE TWO MEMBERS OF THE NETWORK. JOHN RECORDS A TRANSACTION THAT IS ENCRYPTED WITH HIS PRIVATE KEY. JILL CAN DECRYPT IT WITH HER PUBLIC KEY. THIS WAY, JILL IS CONFIDENT THAT JOHN MADE THE TRANSACTION. JILL'S PUBLIC KEY WOULDN'T HAVE WORKED IF JOHN'S PRIVATE KEY HAD BEEN TAMPERED WITH.

HOW DOES BLOCKCHAIN WORK?
WHILE UNDERLYING BLOCKCHAIN MECHANISMS ARE COMPLEX, WE GIVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW IN THE FOLLOWING STEPS. BLOCKCHAIN SOFTWARE CAN AUTOMATE MOST OF THESE STEPS:

STEP 1 – RECORD THE TRANSACTION
A BLOCKCHAIN TRANSACTION SHOWS THE MOVEMENT OF PHYSICAL OR DIGITAL ASSETS FROM ONE PARTY TO ANOTHER IN THE BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK. IT IS RECORDED AS A DATA BLOCK AND CAN INCLUDE DETAILS LIKE THESE:

WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THE TRANSACTION?
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE TRANSACTION?
WHEN DID THE TRANSACTION OCCUR?
WHERE DID THE TRANSACTION OCCUR?
WHY DID THE TRANSACTION OCCUR?
HOW MUCH OF THE ASSET WAS EXCHANGED?
HOW MANY PRE-CONDITIONS WERE MET DURING THE TRANSACTION?
STEP 2 – GAIN CONSENSUS

PARAGRAPHS
WHAT THIS HANDOUT IS ABOUT
THIS HANDOUT WILL HELP YOU UNDERSTAND HOW PARAGRAPHS ARE FORMED, HOW TO DEVELOP STRONGER PARAGRAPHS, AND HOW TO COMPLETELY AND CLEARLY EXPRESS YOUR IDEAS.

WHAT IS A PARAGRAPH?
PARAGRAPHS ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF PAPERS. MANY STUDENTS DEFINE PARAGRAPHS IN TERMS OF LENGTH: A PARAGRAPH IS A GROUP OF AT LEAST FIVE SENTENCES, A PARAGRAPH IS HALF A PAGE LONG, ETC. IN REALITY, THOUGH, THE UNITY AND COHERENCE OF IDEAS AMONG SENTENCES IS WHAT CONSTITUTES A PARAGRAPH. A PARAGRAPH IS DEFINED AS “A GROUP OF SENTENCES OR A SINGLE SENTENCE THAT FORMS A UNIT” (LUNSFORD AND CONNORS 116). LENGTH AND APPEARANCE DO NOT DETERMINE WHETHER A SECTION IN A PAPER IS A PARAGRAPH. FOR INSTANCE, IN SOME STYLES OF WRITING, PARTICULARLY JOURNALISTIC STYLES, A PARAGRAPH CAN BE JUST ONE SENTENCE LONG. ULTIMATELY, A PARAGRAPH IS A SENTENCE OR GROUP OF SENTENCES THAT SUPPORT ONE MAIN IDEA. IN THIS HANDOUT, WE WILL REFER TO THIS AS THE “CONTROLLING IDEA,” BECAUSE IT CONTROLS WHAT HAPPENS IN THE REST OF THE PARAGRAPH.
HOW DO I DECIDE WHAT TO PUT IN A PARAGRAPH?
BEFORE YOU CAN BEGIN TO DETERMINE WHAT THE COMPOSITION OF A PARTICULAR PARAGRAPH WILL BE, YOU MUST FIRST DECIDE ON AN ARGUMENT AND A WORKING THESIS STATEMENT FOR YOUR PAPER. WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT IDEA THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO CONVEY TO YOUR READER? THE INFORMATION IN EACH PARAGRAPH MUST BE RELATED TO THAT IDEA. IN OTHER WORDS, YOUR PARAGRAPHS SHOULD REMIND YOUR READER THAT THERE IS A RECURRENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOUR THESIS AND THE INFORMATION IN EACH PARAGRAPH. A WORKING THESIS FUNCTIONS LIKE A SEED FROM WHICH YOUR PAPER, AND YOUR IDEAS, WILL GROW. THE WHOLE PROCESS IS AN ORGANIC ONE—A NATURAL PROGRESSION FROM A SEED TO A FULL-BLOWN PAPER WHERE THERE ARE DIRECT, FAMILIAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ALL OF THE IDEAS IN THE PAPER.

THE DECISION ABOUT WHAT TO PUT INTO YOUR PARAGRAPHS BEGINS WITH THE GERMINATION OF A SEED OF IDEAS; THIS “GERMINATION PROCESS” IS BETTER KNOWN AS BRAINSTORMING. THERE ARE MANY TECHNIQUES FOR BRAINSTORMING; WHICHEVER ONE YOU CHOOSE, THIS STAGE OF PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT CANNOT BE SKIPPED. BUILDING PARAGRAPHS CAN BE LIKE BUILDING A SKYSCRAPER: THERE MUST BE A WELL-PLANNED FOUNDATION THAT SUPPORTS WHAT YOU ARE BUILDING. ANY CRACKS, INCONSISTENCIES, OR OTHER CORRUPTIONS OF THE FOUNDATION CAN CAUSE YOUR WHOLE PAPER TO CRUMBLE.

SO, LET’S SUPPOSE THAT YOU HAVE DONE SOME BRAINSTORMING TO DEVELOP YOUR THESIS. WHAT ELSE SHOULD YOU KEEP IN MIND AS YOU BEGIN TO CREATE PARAGRAPHS? EVERY PARAGRAPH IN A PAPER SHOULD BE:

UNIFIED: ALL OF THE SENTENCES IN A SINGLE PARAGRAPH SHOULD BE RELATED TO A SINGLE CONTROLLING IDEA (OFTEN EXPRESSED IN THE TOPIC SENTENCE OF THE PARAGRAPH).
CLEARLY RELATED TO THE THESIS: THE SENTENCES SHOULD ALL REFER TO THE CENTRAL IDEA, OR THESIS, OF THE PAPER (ROSEN AND BEHRENS 119).
COHERENT: THE SENTENCES SHOULD BE ARRANGED IN A LOGICAL MANNER AND SHOULD FOLLOW A DEFINITE PLAN FOR DEVELOPMENT (ROSEN AND BEHRENS 119).
WELL-DEVELOPED: EVERY IDEA DISCUSSED IN THE PARAGRAPH SHOULD BE ADEQUATELY EXPLAINED AND SUPPORTED THROUGH EVIDENCE AND DETAILS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO EXPLAIN THE PARAGRAPH’S CONTROLLING IDEA (ROSEN AND BEHRENS 119).
HOW DO I ORGANIZE A PARAGRAPH?
THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS TO ORGANIZE A PARAGRAPH. THE ORGANIZATION YOU CHOOSE WILL DEPEND ON THE CONTROLLING IDEA OF THE PARAGRAPH. BELOW ARE A FEW POSSIBILITIES FOR ORGANIZATION, WITH LINKS TO BRIEF EXAMPLES:

NARRATION: TELL A STORY. GO CHRONOLOGICALLY, FROM START TO FINISH. (SEE AN EXAMPLE.)
DESCRIPTION: PROVIDE SPECIFIC DETAILS ABOUT WHAT SOMETHING LOOKS, SMELLS, TASTES, SOUNDS, OR FEELS LIKE. ORGANIZE SPATIALLY, IN ORDER OF APPEARANCE, OR BY TOPIC. (SEE AN EXAMPLE.)
PROCESS: EXPLAIN HOW SOMETHING WORKS, STEP BY STEP. PERHAPS FOLLOW A SEQUENCE—FIRST, SECOND, THIRD. (SEE AN EXAMPLE.)
CLASSIFICATION: SEPARATE INTO GROUPS OR EXPLAIN THE VARIOUS PARTS OF A TOPIC. (SEE AN EXAMPLE.)
ILLUSTRATION: GIVE EXAMPLES AND EXPLAIN HOW THOSE EXAMPLES SUPPORT YOUR POINT. (SEE AN EXAMPLE IN THE 5-STEP PROCESS BELOW.)
ILLUSTRATION PARAGRAPH: A 5-STEP EXAMPLE
FROM THE LIST ABOVE, LET’S CHOOSE “ILLUSTRATION” AS OUR RHETORICAL PURPOSE. WE’LL WALK THROUGH A 5-STEP PROCESS FOR BUILDING A PARAGRAPH THAT ILLUSTRATES A POINT IN AN ARGUMENT. FOR EACH STEP THERE IS AN EXPLANATION AND EXAMPLE. OUR EXAMPLE PARAGRAPH WILL BE ABOUT HUMAN MISCONCEPTIONS OF PIRANHAS.

STEP 1. DECIDE ON A CONTROLLING IDEA AND CREATE A TOPIC SENTENCE
PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT BEGINS WITH THE FORMULATION OF THE CONTROLLING IDEA. THIS IDEA DIRECTS THE PARAGRAPH’S DEVELOPMENT. OFTEN, THE CONTROLLING IDEA OF A PARAGRAPH WILL APPEAR IN THE FORM OF A TOPIC SENTENCE. IN SOME CASES, YOU MAY NEED MORE THAN ONE SENTENCE TO EXPRESS A PARAGRAPH’S CONTROLLING IDEA.

CONTROLLING IDEA AND TOPIC SENTENCE — DESPITE THE FACT THAT PIRANHAS ARE RELATIVELY HARMLESS, MANY PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THE PERVASIVE MYTH THAT PIRANHAS ARE DANGEROUS TO HUMANS.

STEP 2. ELABORATE ON THE CONTROLLING IDEA
PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT CONTINUES WITH AN ELABORATION ON THE CONTROLLING IDEA, PERHAPS WITH AN EXPLANATION, IMPLICATION, OR STATEMENT ABOUT SIGNIFICANCE. OUR EXAMPLE OFFERS A POSSIBLE EXPLANATION FOR THE PERVASIVENESS OF THE MYTH.

ELABORATION — THIS IMPRESSION OF PIRANHAS IS EXACERBATED BY THEIR MISCHARACTERIZATION IN POPULAR MEDIA.

STEP 3. GIVE AN EXAMPLE (OR MULTIPLE EXAMPLES)
PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT PROGRESSES WITH AN EXAMPLE (OR MORE) THAT ILLUSTRATES THE CLAIMS MADE IN THE PREVIOUS SENTENCES.

EXAMPLE — FOR EXAMPLE, THE PROMOTIONAL POSTER FOR THE 1978 HORROR FILM PIRANHA FEATURES AN OVERSIZED PIRANHA POISED TO BITE THE LEG OF AN UNSUSPECTING WOMAN.

STEP 4. EXPLAIN THE EXAMPLE(S)
THE NEXT MOVEMENT IN PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT IS AN EXPLANATION OF EACH EXAMPLE AND ITS RELEVANCE TO THE TOPIC SENTENCE. THE EXPLANATION SHOULD DEMONSTRATE THE VALUE OF THE EXAMPLE AS EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE MAJOR CLAIM, OR FOCUS, IN YOUR PARAGRAPH.

CONTINUE THE PATTERN OF GIVING EXAMPLES AND EXPLAINING THEM UNTIL ALL POINTS/EXAMPLES THAT THE WRITER DEEMS NECESSARY HAVE BEEN MADE AND EXPLAINED. NONE OF YOUR EXAMPLES SHOULD BE LEFT UNEXPLAINED. YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE EXAMPLE AND THE TOPIC SENTENCE IN THE SAME SENTENCE WHICH INTRODUCED THE EXAMPLE. MORE OFTEN, HOWEVER, YOU WILL NEED TO EXPLAIN THAT RELATIONSHIP IN A SEPARATE SENTENCE.

EXPLANATION FOR EXAMPLE — SUCH A TERRIFYING REPRESENTATION EASILY CAPTURES THE IMAGINATION AND PROMOTES UNNECESSARY FEAR.

NOTICE THAT THE EXAMPLE AND EXPLANATION STEPS OF THIS 5-STEP PROCESS (STEPS 3 AND 4) CAN BE REPEATED AS NEEDED. THE IDEA IS THAT YOU CONTINUE TO USE THIS PATTERN UNTIL YOU HAVE COMPLETELY DEVELOPED THE MAIN IDEA OF THE PARAGRAPH.

STEP 5. COMPLETE THE PARAGRAPH’S IDEA OR TRANSITION INTO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH
THE FINAL MOVEMENT IN PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT INVOLVES TYING UP THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE PARAGRAPH. AT THIS POINT, YOU CAN REMIND YOUR READER ABOUT THE RELEVANCE OF THE INFORMATION TO THE LARGER PAPER, OR YOU CAN MAKE A CONCLUDING POINT FOR THIS EXAMPLE. YOU MIGHT, HOWEVER, SIMPLY TRANSITION TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH.

SENTENCES FOR COMPLETING A PARAGRAPH — WHILE THE TROPE OF THE MAN-EATING PIRANHAS LENDS EXCITEMENT TO THE ADVENTURE STORIES, IT BEARS LITTLE RESEMBLANCE TO THE REAL-LIFE PIRANHA. BY PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO FACT THAN FICTION, HUMANS MAY FINALLY BE ABLE TO LET GO OF THIS INACCURATE BELIEF.

FINISHED PARAGRAPH
DESPITE THE FACT THAT PIRANHAS ARE RELATIVELY HARMLESS, MANY PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THE PERVASIVE MYTH THAT PIRANHAS ARE DANGEROUS TO HUMANS. THIS IMPRESSION OF PIRANHAS IS EXACERBATED BY THEIR MISCHARACTERIZATION IN POPULAR MEDIA. FOR EXAMPLE, THE PROMOTIONAL POSTER FOR THE 1978 HORROR FILM PIRANHA FEATURES AN OVERSIZED PIRANHA POISED TO BITE THE LEG OF AN UNSUSPECTING WOMAN. SUCH A TERRIFYING REPRESENTATION EASILY CAPTURES THE IMAGINATION AND PROMOTES UNNECESSARY FEAR. WHILE THE TROPE OF THE MAN-EATING PIRANHAS LENDS EXCITEMENT TO THE ADVENTURE STORIES, IT BEARS LITTLE RESEMBLANCE TO THE REAL-LIFE PIRANHA. BY PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO FACT THAN FICTION, HUMANS MAY FINALLY BE ABLE TO LET GO OF THIS INACCURATE BELIEF.

TROUBLESHOOTING PARAGRAPHS
PROBLEM: THE PARAGRAPH HAS NO TOPIC SENTENCE
IMAGINE EACH PARAGRAPH AS A SANDWICH. THE REAL CONTENT OF THE SANDWICH—THE MEAT OR OTHER FILLING—IS IN THE MIDDLE. IT INCLUDES ALL THE EVIDENCE YOU NEED TO MAKE THE POINT. BUT IT GETS KIND OF MESSY TO EAT A SANDWICH WITHOUT ANY BREAD. YOUR READERS DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH ALL THE EVIDENCE YOU’VE GIVEN THEM. SO, THE TOP SLICE OF BREAD (THE FIRST SENTENCE OF THE PARAGRAPH) EXPLAINS THE TOPIC (OR CONTROLLING IDEA) OF THE PARAGRAPH. AND, THE BOTTOM SLICE (THE LAST SENTENCE OF THE PARAGRAPH) TELLS THE READER HOW THE PARAGRAPH RELATES TO THE BROADER ARGUMENT. IN THE ORIGINAL AND REVISED PARAGRAPHS BELOW, NOTICE HOW A TOPIC SENTENCE EXPRESSING THE CONTROLLING IDEA TELLS THE READER THE POINT OF ALL THE EVIDENCE.

ORIGINAL PARAGRAPH

PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ FIRST INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. THEIR FEAR OF HUMANS MAKES SENSE. FAR MORE PIRANHAS ARE EATEN BY PEOPLE THAN PEOPLE ARE EATEN BY PIRANHAS. IF THE FISH ARE WELL-FED, THEY WON’T BITE HUMANS.

REVISED PARAGRAPH

ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER PIRANHAS TO BE QUITE DANGEROUS, THEY ARE, FOR THE MOST PART, ENTIRELY HARMLESS. PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ FIRST INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. THEIR FEAR OF HUMANS MAKES SENSE. FAR MORE PIRANHAS ARE EATEN BY PEOPLE THAN PEOPLE ARE EATEN BY PIRANHAS. IF THE FISH ARE WELL-FED, THEY WON’T BITE HUMANS.

ONCE YOU HAVE MASTERED THE USE OF TOPIC SENTENCES, YOU MAY DECIDE THAT THE TOPIC SENTENCE FOR A PARTICULAR PARAGRAPH REALLY SHOULDN’T BE THE FIRST SENTENCE OF THE PARAGRAPH. THIS IS FINE—THE TOPIC SENTENCE CAN ACTUALLY GO AT THE BEGINNING, MIDDLE, OR END OF A PARAGRAPH; WHAT’S IMPORTANT IS THAT IT IS IN THERE SOMEWHERE SO THAT READERS KNOW WHAT THE MAIN IDEA OF THE PARAGRAPH IS AND HOW IT RELATES BACK TO THE THESIS OF YOUR PAPER. SUPPOSE THAT WE WANTED TO START THE PIRANHA PARAGRAPH WITH A TRANSITION SENTENCE—SOMETHING THAT REMINDS THE READER OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH—RATHER THAN WITH THE TOPIC SENTENCE. LET’S SUPPOSE THAT THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH WAS ABOUT ALL KINDS OF ANIMALS THAT PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF, LIKE SHARKS, SNAKES, AND SPIDERS. OUR PARAGRAPH MIGHT LOOK LIKE THIS (THE TOPIC SENTENCE IS BOLD):

LIKE SHARKS, SNAKES, AND SPIDERS, PIRANHAS ARE WIDELY FEARED. ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER PIRANHAS TO BE QUITE DANGEROUS, THEY ARE, FOR THE MOST PART, ENTIRELY HARMLESS. PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ FIRST INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. THEIR FEAR OF HUMANS MAKES SENSE. FAR MORE PIRANHAS ARE EATEN BY PEOPLE THAN PEOPLE ARE EATEN BY PIRANHAS. IF THE FISH ARE WELL-FED, THEY WON’T BITE HUMANS.

PROBLEM: THE PARAGRAPH HAS MORE THAN ONE CONTROLLING IDEA
IF A PARAGRAPH HAS MORE THAN ONE MAIN IDEA, CONSIDER ELIMINATING SENTENCES THAT RELATE TO THE SECOND IDEA, OR SPLIT THE PARAGRAPH INTO TWO OR MORE PARAGRAPHS, EACH WITH ONLY ONE MAIN IDEA. WATCH OUR SHORT VIDEO ON REVERSE OUTLINING TO LEARN A QUICK WAY TO TEST WHETHER YOUR PARAGRAPHS ARE UNIFIED. IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH, THE FINAL TWO SENTENCES BRANCH OFF INTO A DIFFERENT TOPIC; SO, THE REVISED PARAGRAPH ELIMINATES THEM AND CONCLUDES WITH A SENTENCE THAT REMINDS THE READER OF THE PARAGRAPH’S MAIN IDEA.

ORIGINAL PARAGRAPH

ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER PIRANHAS TO BE QUITE DANGEROUS, THEY ARE, FOR THE MOST PART, ENTIRELY HARMLESS. PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ FIRST INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. THEIR FEAR OF HUMANS MAKES SENSE. FAR MORE PIRANHAS ARE EATEN BY PEOPLE THAN PEOPLE ARE EATEN BY PIRANHAS. A NUMBER OF SOUTH AMERICAN GROUPS EAT PIRANHAS. THEY FRY OR GRILL THE FISH AND THEN SERVE THEM WITH COCONUT MILK OR TUCUPI, A SAUCE MADE FROM FERMENTED MANIOC JUICES.

REVISED PARAGRAPH

ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER PIRANHAS TO BE QUITE DANGEROUS, THEY ARE, FOR THE MOST PART, ENTIRELY HARMLESS. PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ FIRST INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. THEIR FEAR OF HUMANS MAKES SENSE. FAR MORE PIRANHAS ARE EATEN BY PEOPLE THAN PEOPLE ARE EATEN BY PIRANHAS. IF THE FISH ARE WELL-FED, THEY WON’T BITE HUMANS.

PROBLEM: TRANSITIONS ARE NEEDED WITHIN THE PARAGRAPH
YOU ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH THE IDEA THAT TRANSITIONS MAY BE NEEDED BETWEEN PARAGRAPHS OR SECTIONS IN A PAPER (SEE OUR HANDOUT ON TRANSITIONS). SOMETIMES THEY ARE ALSO HELPFUL WITHIN THE BODY OF A SINGLE PARAGRAPH. WITHIN A PARAGRAPH, TRANSITIONS ARE OFTEN SINGLE WORDS OR SHORT PHRASES THAT HELP TO ESTABLISH RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN IDEAS AND TO CREATE A LOGICAL PROGRESSION OF THOSE IDEAS IN A PARAGRAPH. THIS IS ESPECIALLY LIKELY TO BE TRUE WITHIN PARAGRAPHS THAT DISCUSS MULTIPLE EXAMPLES. LET’S TAKE A LOOK AT A VERSION OF OUR PIRANHA PARAGRAPH THAT USES TRANSITIONS TO ORIENT THE READER:

ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER PIRANHAS TO BE QUITE DANGEROUS, THEY ARE, EXCEPT IN TWO MAIN SITUATIONS, ENTIRELY HARMLESS. PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. BUT THERE ARE TWO SITUATIONS IN WHICH A PIRANHA BITE IS LIKELY. THE FIRST IS WHEN A FRIGHTENED PIRANHA IS LIFTED OUT OF THE WATER—FOR EXAMPLE, IF IT HAS BEEN CAUGHT IN A FISHING NET. THE SECOND IS WHEN THE WATER LEVEL IN POOLS WHERE PIRANHAS ARE LIVING FALLS TOO LOW. A LARGE NUMBER OF FISH MAY BE TRAPPED IN A SINGLE POOL, AND IF THEY ARE HUNGRY, THEY MAY ATTACK ANYTHING THAT ENTERS THE WATER.

IN THIS EXAMPLE, YOU CAN SEE HOW THE PHRASES “THE FIRST” AND “THE SECOND” HELP THE READER FOLLOW THE ORGANIZATION OF THE IDEAS IN THE PARAGRAPH.

HOW DO I DECIDE WHAT TO PUT IN A PARAGRAPH?
BEFORE YOU CAN BEGIN TO DETERMINE WHAT THE COMPOSITION OF A PARTICULAR PARAGRAPH WILL BE, YOU MUST FIRST DECIDE ON AN ARGUMENT AND A WORKING THESIS STATEMENT FOR YOUR PAPER. WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT IDEA THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO CONVEY TO YOUR READER? THE INFORMATION IN EACH PARAGRAPH MUST BE RELATED TO THAT IDEA. IN OTHER WORDS, YOUR PARAGRAPHS SHOULD REMIND YOUR READER THAT THERE IS A RECURRENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOUR THESIS AND THE INFORMATION IN EACH PARAGRAPH. A WORKING THESIS FUNCTIONS LIKE A SEED FROM WHICH YOUR PAPER, AND YOUR IDEAS, WILL GROW. THE WHOLE PROCESS IS AN ORGANIC ONE—A NATURAL PROGRESSION FROM A SEED TO A FULL-BLOWN PAPER WHERE THERE ARE DIRECT, FAMILIAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ALL OF THE IDEAS IN THE PAPER.

THE DECISION ABOUT WHAT TO PUT INTO YOUR PARAGRAPHS BEGINS WITH THE GERMINATION OF A SEED OF IDEAS; THIS “GERMINATION PROCESS” IS BETTER KNOWN AS BRAINSTORMING. THERE ARE MANY TECHNIQUES FOR BRAINSTORMING; WHICHEVER ONE YOU CHOOSE, THIS STAGE OF PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT CANNOT BE SKIPPED. BUILDING PARAGRAPHS CAN BE LIKE BUILDING A SKYSCRAPER: THERE MUST BE A WELL-PLANNED FOUNDATION THAT SUPPORTS WHAT YOU ARE BUILDING. ANY CRACKS, INCONSISTENCIES, OR OTHER CORRUPTIONS OF THE FOUNDATION CAN CAUSE YOUR WHOLE PAPER TO CRUMBLE.

SO, LET’S SUPPOSE THAT YOU HAVE DONE SOME BRAINSTORMING TO DEVELOP YOUR THESIS. WHAT ELSE SHOULD YOU KEEP IN MIND AS YOU BEGIN TO CREATE PARAGRAPHS? EVERY PARAGRAPH IN A PAPER SHOULD BE:

UNIFIED: ALL OF THE SENTENCES IN A SINGLE PARAGRAPH SHOULD BE RELATED TO A SINGLE CONTROLLING IDEA (OFTEN EXPRESSED IN THE TOPIC SENTENCE OF THE PARAGRAPH).
CLEARLY RELATED TO THE THESIS: THE SENTENCES SHOULD ALL REFER TO THE CENTRAL IDEA, OR THESIS, OF THE PAPER (ROSEN AND BEHRENS 119).
COHERENT: THE SENTENCES SHOULD BE ARRANGED IN A LOGICAL MANNER AND SHOULD FOLLOW A DEFINITE PLAN FOR DEVELOPMENT (ROSEN AND BEHRENS 119).
WELL-DEVELOPED: EVERY IDEA DISCUSSED IN THE PARAGRAPH SHOULD BE ADEQUATELY EXPLAINED AND SUPPORTED THROUGH EVIDENCE AND DETAILS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO EXPLAIN THE PARAGRAPH’S CONTROLLING IDEA (ROSEN AND BEHRENS 119).
HOW DO I ORGANIZE A PARAGRAPH?
THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS TO ORGANIZE A PARAGRAPH. THE ORGANIZATION YOU CHOOSE WILL DEPEND ON THE CONTROLLING IDEA OF THE PARAGRAPH. BELOW ARE A FEW POSSIBILITIES FOR ORGANIZATION, WITH LINKS TO BRIEF EXAMPLES:

NARRATION: TELL A STORY. GO CHRONOLOGICALLY, FROM START TO FINISH. (SEE AN EXAMPLE.)
DESCRIPTION: PROVIDE SPECIFIC DETAILS ABOUT WHAT SOMETHING LOOKS, SMELLS, TASTES, SOUNDS, OR FEELS LIKE. ORGANIZE SPATIALLY, IN ORDER OF APPEARANCE, OR BY TOPIC. (SEE AN EXAMPLE.)
PROCESS: EXPLAIN HOW SOMETHING WORKS, STEP BY STEP. PERHAPS FOLLOW A SEQUENCE—FIRST, SECOND, THIRD. (SEE AN EXAMPLE.)
CLASSIFICATION: SEPARATE INTO GROUPS OR EXPLAIN THE VARIOUS PARTS OF A TOPIC. (SEE AN EXAMPLE.)
ILLUSTRATION: GIVE EXAMPLES AND EXPLAIN HOW THOSE EXAMPLES SUPPORT YOUR POINT. (SEE AN EXAMPLE IN THE 5-STEP PROCESS BELOW.)
ILLUSTRATION PARAGRAPH: A 5-STEP EXAMPLE
FROM THE LIST ABOVE, LET’S CHOOSE “ILLUSTRATION” AS OUR RHETORICAL PURPOSE. WE’LL WALK THROUGH A 5-STEP PROCESS FOR BUILDING A PARAGRAPH THAT ILLUSTRATES A POINT IN AN ARGUMENT. FOR EACH STEP THERE IS AN EXPLANATION AND EXAMPLE. OUR EXAMPLE PARAGRAPH WILL BE ABOUT HUMAN MISCONCEPTIONS OF PIRANHAS.

STEP 1. DECIDE ON A CONTROLLING IDEA AND CREATE A TOPIC SENTENCE
PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT BEGINS WITH THE FORMULATION OF THE CONTROLLING IDEA. THIS IDEA DIRECTS THE PARAGRAPH’S DEVELOPMENT. OFTEN, THE CONTROLLING IDEA OF A PARAGRAPH WILL APPEAR IN THE FORM OF A TOPIC SENTENCE. IN SOME CASES, YOU MAY NEED MORE THAN ONE SENTENCE TO EXPRESS A PARAGRAPH’S CONTROLLING IDEA.

CONTROLLING IDEA AND TOPIC SENTENCE — DESPITE THE FACT THAT PIRANHAS ARE RELATIVELY HARMLESS, MANY PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THE PERVASIVE MYTH THAT PIRANHAS ARE DANGEROUS TO HUMANS.

STEP 2. ELABORATE ON THE CONTROLLING IDEA
PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT CONTINUES WITH AN ELABORATION ON THE CONTROLLING IDEA, PERHAPS WITH AN EXPLANATION, IMPLICATION, OR STATEMENT ABOUT SIGNIFICANCE. OUR EXAMPLE OFFERS A POSSIBLE EXPLANATION FOR THE PERVASIVENESS OF THE MYTH.

ELABORATION — THIS IMPRESSION OF PIRANHAS IS EXACERBATED BY THEIR MISCHARACTERIZATION IN POPULAR MEDIA.

STEP 3. GIVE AN EXAMPLE (OR MULTIPLE EXAMPLES)
PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT PROGRESSES WITH AN EXAMPLE (OR MORE) THAT ILLUSTRATES THE CLAIMS MADE IN THE PREVIOUS SENTENCES.

EXAMPLE — FOR EXAMPLE, THE PROMOTIONAL POSTER FOR THE 1978 HORROR FILM PIRANHA FEATURES AN OVERSIZED PIRANHA POISED TO BITE THE LEG OF AN UNSUSPECTING WOMAN.

STEP 4. EXPLAIN THE EXAMPLE(S)
THE NEXT MOVEMENT IN PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT IS AN EXPLANATION OF EACH EXAMPLE AND ITS RELEVANCE TO THE TOPIC SENTENCE. THE EXPLANATION SHOULD DEMONSTRATE THE VALUE OF THE EXAMPLE AS EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE MAJOR CLAIM, OR FOCUS, IN YOUR PARAGRAPH.

CONTINUE THE PATTERN OF GIVING EXAMPLES AND EXPLAINING THEM UNTIL ALL POINTS/EXAMPLES THAT THE WRITER DEEMS NECESSARY HAVE BEEN MADE AND EXPLAINED. NONE OF YOUR EXAMPLES SHOULD BE LEFT UNEXPLAINED. YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE EXAMPLE AND THE TOPIC SENTENCE IN THE SAME SENTENCE WHICH INTRODUCED THE EXAMPLE. MORE OFTEN, HOWEVER, YOU WILL NEED TO EXPLAIN THAT RELATIONSHIP IN A SEPARATE SENTENCE.

EXPLANATION FOR EXAMPLE — SUCH A TERRIFYING REPRESENTATION EASILY CAPTURES THE IMAGINATION AND PROMOTES UNNECESSARY FEAR.

NOTICE THAT THE EXAMPLE AND EXPLANATION STEPS OF THIS 5-STEP PROCESS (STEPS 3 AND 4) CAN BE REPEATED AS NEEDED. THE IDEA IS THAT YOU CONTINUE TO USE THIS PATTERN UNTIL YOU HAVE COMPLETELY DEVELOPED THE MAIN IDEA OF THE PARAGRAPH.

STEP 5. COMPLETE THE PARAGRAPH’S IDEA OR TRANSITION INTO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH
THE FINAL MOVEMENT IN PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT INVOLVES TYING UP THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE PARAGRAPH. AT THIS POINT, YOU CAN REMIND YOUR READER ABOUT THE RELEVANCE OF THE INFORMATION TO THE LARGER PAPER, OR YOU CAN MAKE A CONCLUDING POINT FOR THIS EXAMPLE. YOU MIGHT, HOWEVER, SIMPLY TRANSITION TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH.

SENTENCES FOR COMPLETING A PARAGRAPH — WHILE THE TROPE OF THE MAN-EATING PIRANHAS LENDS EXCITEMENT TO THE ADVENTURE STORIES, IT BEARS LITTLE RESEMBLANCE TO THE REAL-LIFE PIRANHA. BY PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO FACT THAN FICTION, HUMANS MAY FINALLY BE ABLE TO LET GO OF THIS INACCURATE BELIEF.

FINISHED PARAGRAPH
DESPITE THE FACT THAT PIRANHAS ARE RELATIVELY HARMLESS, MANY PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THE PERVASIVE MYTH THAT PIRANHAS ARE DANGEROUS TO HUMANS. THIS IMPRESSION OF PIRANHAS IS EXACERBATED BY THEIR MISCHARACTERIZATION IN POPULAR MEDIA. FOR EXAMPLE, THE PROMOTIONAL POSTER FOR THE 1978 HORROR FILM PIRANHA FEATURES AN OVERSIZED PIRANHA POISED TO BITE THE LEG OF AN UNSUSPECTING WOMAN. SUCH A TERRIFYING REPRESENTATION EASILY CAPTURES THE IMAGINATION AND PROMOTES UNNECESSARY FEAR. WHILE THE TROPE OF THE MAN-EATING PIRANHAS LENDS EXCITEMENT TO THE ADVENTURE STORIES, IT BEARS LITTLE RESEMBLANCE TO THE REAL-LIFE PIRANHA. BY PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO FACT THAN FICTION, HUMANS MAY FINALLY BE ABLE TO LET GO OF THIS INACCURATE BELIEF.

TROUBLESHOOTING PARAGRAPHS
PROBLEM: THE PARAGRAPH HAS NO TOPIC SENTENCE
IMAGINE EACH PARAGRAPH AS A SANDWICH. THE REAL CONTENT OF THE SANDWICH—THE MEAT OR OTHER FILLING—IS IN THE MIDDLE. IT INCLUDES ALL THE EVIDENCE YOU NEED TO MAKE THE POINT. BUT IT GETS KIND OF MESSY TO EAT A SANDWICH WITHOUT ANY BREAD. YOUR READERS DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH ALL THE EVIDENCE YOU’VE GIVEN THEM. SO, THE TOP SLICE OF BREAD (THE FIRST SENTENCE OF THE PARAGRAPH) EXPLAINS THE TOPIC (OR CONTROLLING IDEA) OF THE PARAGRAPH. AND, THE BOTTOM SLICE (THE LAST SENTENCE OF THE PARAGRAPH) TELLS THE READER HOW THE PARAGRAPH RELATES TO THE BROADER ARGUMENT. IN THE ORIGINAL AND REVISED PARAGRAPHS BELOW, NOTICE HOW A TOPIC SENTENCE EXPRESSING THE CONTROLLING IDEA TELLS THE READER THE POINT OF ALL THE EVIDENCE.

ORIGINAL PARAGRAPH

PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ FIRST INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. THEIR FEAR OF HUMANS MAKES SENSE. FAR MORE PIRANHAS ARE EATEN BY PEOPLE THAN PEOPLE ARE EATEN BY PIRANHAS. IF THE FISH ARE WELL-FED, THEY WON’T BITE HUMANS.

REVISED PARAGRAPH

ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER PIRANHAS TO BE QUITE DANGEROUS, THEY ARE, FOR THE MOST PART, ENTIRELY HARMLESS. PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ FIRST INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. THEIR FEAR OF HUMANS MAKES SENSE. FAR MORE PIRANHAS ARE EATEN BY PEOPLE THAN PEOPLE ARE EATEN BY PIRANHAS. IF THE FISH ARE WELL-FED, THEY WON’T BITE HUMANS.

ONCE YOU HAVE MASTERED THE USE OF TOPIC SENTENCES, YOU MAY DECIDE THAT THE TOPIC SENTENCE FOR A PARTICULAR PARAGRAPH REALLY SHOULDN’T BE THE FIRST SENTENCE OF THE PARAGRAPH. THIS IS FINE—THE TOPIC SENTENCE CAN ACTUALLY GO AT THE BEGINNING, MIDDLE, OR END OF A PARAGRAPH; WHAT’S IMPORTANT IS THAT IT IS IN THERE SOMEWHERE SO THAT READERS KNOW WHAT THE MAIN IDEA OF THE PARAGRAPH IS AND HOW IT RELATES BACK TO THE THESIS OF YOUR PAPER. SUPPOSE THAT WE WANTED TO START THE PIRANHA PARAGRAPH WITH A TRANSITION SENTENCE—SOMETHING THAT REMINDS THE READER OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH—RATHER THAN WITH THE TOPIC SENTENCE. LET’S SUPPOSE THAT THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH WAS ABOUT ALL KINDS OF ANIMALS THAT PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF, LIKE SHARKS, SNAKES, AND SPIDERS. OUR PARAGRAPH MIGHT LOOK LIKE THIS (THE TOPIC SENTENCE IS BOLD):

LIKE SHARKS, SNAKES, AND SPIDERS, PIRANHAS ARE WIDELY FEARED. ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER PIRANHAS TO BE QUITE DANGEROUS, THEY ARE, FOR THE MOST PART, ENTIRELY HARMLESS. PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ FIRST INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. THEIR FEAR OF HUMANS MAKES SENSE. FAR MORE PIRANHAS ARE EATEN BY PEOPLE THAN PEOPLE ARE EATEN BY PIRANHAS. IF THE FISH ARE WELL-FED, THEY WON’T BITE HUMANS.

PROBLEM: THE PARAGRAPH HAS MORE THAN ONE CONTROLLING IDEA
IF A PARAGRAPH HAS MORE THAN ONE MAIN IDEA, CONSIDER ELIMINATING SENTENCES THAT RELATE TO THE SECOND IDEA, OR SPLIT THE PARAGRAPH INTO TWO OR MORE PARAGRAPHS, EACH WITH ONLY ONE MAIN IDEA. WATCH OUR SHORT VIDEO ON REVERSE OUTLINING TO LEARN A QUICK WAY TO TEST WHETHER YOUR PARAGRAPHS ARE UNIFIED. IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH, THE FINAL TWO SENTENCES BRANCH OFF INTO A DIFFERENT TOPIC; SO, THE REVISED PARAGRAPH ELIMINATES THEM AND CONCLUDES WITH A SENTENCE THAT REMINDS THE READER OF THE PARAGRAPH’S MAIN IDEA.

ORIGINAL PARAGRAPH

ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER PIRANHAS TO BE QUITE DANGEROUS, THEY ARE, FOR THE MOST PART, ENTIRELY HARMLESS. PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ FIRST INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. THEIR FEAR OF HUMANS MAKES SENSE. FAR MORE PIRANHAS ARE EATEN BY PEOPLE THAN PEOPLE ARE EATEN BY PIRANHAS. A NUMBER OF SOUTH AMERICAN GROUPS EAT PIRANHAS. THEY FRY OR GRILL THE FISH AND THEN SERVE THEM WITH COCONUT MILK OR TUCUPI, A SAUCE MADE FROM FERMENTED MANIOC JUICES.

REVISED PARAGRAPH

ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER PIRANHAS TO BE QUITE DANGEROUS, THEY ARE, FOR THE MOST PART, ENTIRELY HARMLESS. PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ FIRST INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. THEIR FEAR OF HUMANS MAKES SENSE. FAR MORE PIRANHAS ARE EATEN BY PEOPLE THAN PEOPLE ARE EATEN BY PIRANHAS. IF THE FISH ARE WELL-FED, THEY WON’T BITE HUMANS.

PROBLEM: TRANSITIONS ARE NEEDED WITHIN THE PARAGRAPH
YOU ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH THE IDEA THAT TRANSITIONS MAY BE NEEDED BETWEEN PARAGRAPHS OR SECTIONS IN A PAPER (SEE OUR HANDOUT ON TRANSITIONS). SOMETIMES THEY ARE ALSO HELPFUL WITHIN THE BODY OF A SINGLE PARAGRAPH. WITHIN A PARAGRAPH, TRANSITIONS ARE OFTEN SINGLE WORDS OR SHORT PHRASES THAT HELP TO ESTABLISH RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN IDEAS AND TO CREATE A LOGICAL PROGRESSION OF THOSE IDEAS IN A PARAGRAPH. THIS IS ESPECIALLY LIKELY TO BE TRUE WITHIN PARAGRAPHS THAT DISCUSS MULTIPLE EXAMPLES. LET’S TAKE A LOOK AT A VERSION OF OUR PIRANHA PARAGRAPH THAT USES TRANSITIONS TO ORIENT THE READER:

ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER PIRANHAS TO BE QUITE DANGEROUS, THEY ARE, EXCEPT IN TWO MAIN SITUATIONS, ENTIRELY HARMLESS. PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. BUT THERE ARE TWO SITUATIONS IN WHICH A PIRANHA BITE IS LIKELY. THE FIRST IS WHEN A FRIGHTENED PIRANHA IS LIFTED OUT OF THE WATER—FOR EXAMPLE, IF IT HAS BEEN CAUGHT IN A FISHING NET. THE SECOND IS WHEN THE WATER LEVEL IN POOLS WHERE PIRANHAS ARE LIVING FALLS TOO LOW. A LARGE NUMBER OF FISH MAY BE TRAPPED IN A SINGLE POOL, AND IF THEY ARE HUNGRY, THEY MAY ATTACK ANYTHING THAT ENTERS THE WATER.

IN THIS EXAMPLE, YOU CAN SEE HOW THE PHRASES “THE FIRST” AND “THE SECOND” HELP THE READER FOLLOW THE ORGANIZATION OF THE IDEAS IN THE PARAGRAPH.

BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY IS AN ADVANCED DATABASE MECHANISM THAT ALLOWS TRANSPARENT INFORMATION SHARING WITHIN A BUSINESS 
NETWORK. A BLOCKCHAIN DATABASE STORES DATA IN BLOCKS THAT ARE LINKED TOGETHER IN A CHAIN. THE DATA IS CHRONOLOGICALLY 
CONSISTENT BECAUSE YOU CANNOT DELETE OR MODIFY THE CHAIN WITHOUT CONSENSUS FROM THE NETWORK. AS A RESULT, YOU CAN USE
 BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE AN UNALTERABLE OR IMMUTABLE LEDGER FOR TRACKING ORDERS, PAYMENTS, ACCOUNTS, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS. THE SYSTEM HAS BUILT-IN MECHANISMS THAT PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTION ENTRIES AND CREATE CONSISTENCY IN THE SHARED VIEW OF THESE TRANSACTIONS.
TRADITIONAL DATABASE TECHNOLOGIES PRESENT SEVERAL CHALLENGES FOR RECORDING FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS. FOR INSTANCE, CONSIDER THE SALE OF A PROPERTY. ONCE THE MONEY IS EXCHANGED, OWNERSHIP OF THE PROPERTY IS TRANSFERRED TO THE BUYER. INDIVIDUALLY, BOTH THE BUYER AND THE SELLER CAN RECORD THE MONETARY TRANSACTIONS, BUT NEITHER SOURCE CAN BE TRUSTED. THE SELLER CAN EASILY CLAIM THEY HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE MONEY EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE, AND THE BUYER CAN EQUALLY ARGUE THAT THEY HAVE PAID THE MONEY EVEN IF THEY HAVEN’T.

TO AVOID POTENTIAL LEGAL ISSUES, A TRUSTED THIRD PARTY HAS TO SUPERVISE AND VALIDATE TRANSACTIONS. THE PRESENCE OF THIS CENTRAL AUTHORITY NOT ONLY COMPLICATES THE TRANSACTION BUT ALSO CREATES A SINGLE POINT OF VULNERABILITY. IF THE CENTRAL DATABASE WAS COMPROMISED, BOTH PARTIES COULD SUFFER.

BLOCKCHAIN MITIGATES SUCH ISSUES BY CREATING A DECENTRALIZED, TAMPER-PROOF SYSTEM TO RECORD TRANSACTIONS. IN THE PROPERTY TRANSACTION SCENARIO, BLOCKCHAIN CREATES ONE LEDGER EACH FOR THE BUYER AND THE SELLER. ALL TRANSACTIONS MUST BE APPROVED BY BOTH PARTIES AND ARE AUTOMATICALLY UPDATED IN BOTH OF THEIR LEDGERS IN REAL TIME. ANY CORRUPTION IN HISTORICAL TRANSACTIONS WILL CORRUPT THE ENTIRE LEDGER. THESE PROPERTIES OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY HAVE LED TO ITS USE IN VARIOUS SECTORS, INCLUDING THE CREATION OF DIGITAL CURRENCY LIKE BITCOIN.
HOW DO DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES USE BLOCKCHAIN?
BLOCKCHAIN IS AN EMERGING TECHNOLOGY THAT IS BEING ADOPTED IN INNOVATIVE MANNER BY VARIOUS INDUSTRIES. WE DESCRIBE SOME USE CASES IN DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES IN THE FOLLOWING SUBSECTIONS:


ENERGY
ENERGY COMPANIES USE BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE PEER-TO-PEER ENERGY TRADING PLATFORMS AND STREAMLINE ACCESS TO RENEWABLE ENERGY. FOR EXAMPLE, CONSIDER THESE USES:

BLOCKCHAIN-BASED ENERGY COMPANIES HAVE CREATED A TRADING PLATFORM FOR THE SALE OF ELECTRICITY BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS. HOMEOWNERS WITH SOLAR PANELS USE THIS PLATFORM TO SELL THEIR EXCESS SOLAR ENERGY TO NEIGHBORS. THE PROCESS IS LARGELY AUTOMATED: SMART METERS CREATE TRANSACTIONS, AND BLOCKCHAIN RECORDS THEM.
WITH BLOCKCHAIN-BASED CROWD FUNDING INITIATIVES, USERS CAN SPONSOR AND OWN SOLAR PANELS IN COMMUNITIES THAT LACK ENERGY ACCESS. SPONSORS MIGHT ALSO RECEIVE RENT FOR THESE COMMUNITIES ONCE THE SOLAR PANELS ARE CONSTRUCTED.
FINANCE
TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL SYSTEMS, LIKE BANKS AND STOCK EXCHANGES, USE BLOCKCHAIN SERVICES TO MANAGE ONLINE PAYMENTS, ACCOUNTS, AND MARKET TRADING. FOR EXAMPLE, SINGAPORE EXCHANGE LIMITED, AN INVESTMENT HOLDING COMPANY THAT PROVIDES FINANCIAL TRADING SERVICES THROUGHOUT ASIA, USES BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY TO BUILD A MORE EFFICIENT INTERBANK PAYMENT ACCOUNT. BY ADOPTING BLOCKCHAIN, THEY SOLVED SEVERAL CHALLENGES, INCLUDING BATCH PROCESSING AND MANUAL RECONCILIATION OF SEVERAL THOUSAND FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS.

MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT
COMPANIES IN MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT USE BLOCKCHAIN SYSTEMS TO MANAGE COPYRIGHT DATA. COPYRIGHT VERIFICATION IS CRITICAL FOR THE FAIR COMPENSATION OF ARTISTS. IT TAKES MULTIPLE TRANSACTIONS TO RECORD THE SALE OR TRANSFER OF COPYRIGHT CONTENT. SONY MUSIC ENTERTAINMENT JAPAN USES BLOCKCHAIN SERVICES TO MAKE DIGITAL RIGHTS MANAGEMENT MORE EFFICIENT. THEY HAVE SUCCESSFULLY USED BLOCKCHAIN STRATEGY TO IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY AND REDUCE COSTS IN COPYRIGHT PROCESSING.

RETAIL
RETAIL COMPANIES USE BLOCKCHAIN TO TRACK THE MOVEMENT OF GOODS BETWEEN SUPPLIERS AND BUYERS. FOR EXAMPLE, AMAZON RETAIL HAS FILED A PATENT FOR A DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM THAT WILL USE BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY TO VERIFY THAT ALL GOODS SOLD ON THE PLATFORM ARE AUTHENTIC. AMAZON SELLERS CAN MAP THEIR GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS BY ALLOWING PARTICIPANTS SUCH AS MANUFACTURERS, COURIERS, DISTRIBUTORS, END USERS, AND SECONDARY USERS TO ADD EVENTS TO THE LEDGER AFTER REGISTERING WITH A CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY. 

WHAT ARE THE FEATURES OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY?
BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY HAS THE FOLLOWING MAIN FEATURES:

DECENTRALIZATION
DECENTRALIZATION IN BLOCKCHAIN REFERS TO TRANSFERRING CONTROL AND DECISION MAKING FROM A CENTRALIZED ENTITY (INDIVIDUAL, ORGANIZATION, OR GROUP) TO A DISTRIBUTED NETWORK. DECENTRALIZED BLOCKCHAIN NETWORKS USE TRANSPARENCY TO REDUCE THE NEED FOR TRUST AMONG PARTICIPANTS. THESE NETWORKS ALSO DETER PARTICIPANTS FROM EXERTING AUTHORITY OR CONTROL OVER ONE ANOTHER IN WAYS THAT DEGRADE THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE NETWORK.

IMMUTABILITY
IMMUTABILITY MEANS SOMETHING CANNOT BE CHANGED OR ALTERED. NO PARTICIPANT CAN TAMPER WITH A TRANSACTION ONCE SOMEONE HAS RECORDED IT TO THE SHARED LEDGER. IF A TRANSACTION RECORD INCLUDES AN ERROR, YOU MUST ADD A NEW TRANSACTION TO REVERSE THE MISTAKE, AND BOTH TRANSACTIONS ARE VISIBLE TO THE NETWORK.

CONSENSUS
A BLOCKCHAIN SYSTEM ESTABLISHES RULES ABOUT PARTICIPANT CONSENT FOR RECORDING TRANSACTIONS. YOU CAN RECORD NEW TRANSACTIONS ONLY WHEN THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE NETWORK GIVE THEIR CONSENT.

WHAT ARE THE KEY COMPONENTS OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY?
BLOCKCHAIN ARCHITECTURE HAS THE FOLLOWING MAIN COMPONENTS:

A DISTRIBUTED LEDGER

A DISTRIBUTED LEDGER IS THE SHARED DATABASE IN THE BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK THAT STORES THE TRANSACTIONS, SUCH AS A SHARED FILE THAT EVERYONE IN THE TEAM CAN EDIT. IN MOST SHARED TEXT EDITORS, ANYONE WITH EDITING RIGHTS CAN DELETE THE ENTIRE FILE. HOWEVER, DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGIES HAVE STRICT RULES ABOUT WHO CAN EDIT AND HOW TO EDIT. YOU CANNOT DELETE ENTRIES ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN RECORDED.

SMART CONTRACTS
COMPANIES USE SMART CONTRACTS TO SELF-MANAGE BUSINESS CONTRACTS WITHOUT THE NEED FOR AN ASSISTING THIRD PARTY. THEY ARE PROGRAMS STORED ON THE BLOCKCHAIN SYSTEM THAT RUN AUTOMATICALLY WHEN PREDETERMINED CONDITIONS ARE MET. THEY RUN IF-THEN CHECKS SO THAT TRANSACTIONS CAN BE COMPLETED CONFIDENTLY. FOR EXAMPLE, A LOGISTICS COMPANY CAN HAVE A SMART CONTRACT THAT AUTOMATICALLY MAKES PAYMENT ONCE GOODS HAVE ARRIVED AT THE PORT.

PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY
PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY IS A SECURITY FEATURE TO UNIQUELY IDENTIFY PARTICIPANTS IN THE BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK. THIS MECHANISM GENERATES TWO SETS OF KEYS FOR NETWORK MEMBERS. ONE KEY IS A PUBLIC KEY THAT IS COMMON TO EVERYONE IN THE NETWORK. THE OTHER IS A PRIVATE KEY THAT IS UNIQUE TO EVERY MEMBER. THE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC KEYS WORK TOGETHER TO UNLOCK THE DATA IN THE LEDGER. 

FOR EXAMPLE, JOHN AND JILL ARE TWO MEMBERS OF THE NETWORK. JOHN RECORDS A TRANSACTION THAT IS ENCRYPTED WITH HIS PRIVATE KEY. JILL CAN DECRYPT IT WITH HER PUBLIC KEY. THIS WAY, JILL IS CONFIDENT THAT JOHN MADE THE TRANSACTION. JILL'S PUBLIC KEY WOULDN'T HAVE WORKED IF JOHN'S PRIVATE KEY HAD BEEN TAMPERED WITH.

HOW DOES BLOCKCHAIN WORK?
WHILE UNDERLYING BLOCKCHAIN MECHANISMS ARE COMPLEX, WE GIVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW IN THE FOLLOWING STEPS. BLOCKCHAIN SOFTWARE CAN AUTOMATE MOST OF THESE STEPS:

STEP 1 – RECORD THE TRANSACTION
A BLOCKCHAIN TRANSACTION SHOWS THE MOVEMENT OF PHYSICAL OR DIGITAL ASSETS FROM ONE PARTY TO ANOTHER IN THE BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK. IT IS RECORDED AS A DATA BLOCK AND CAN INCLUDE DETAILS LIKE THESE:

WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THE TRANSACTION?
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE TRANSACTION?
WHEN DID THE TRANSACTION OCCUR?
WHERE DID THE TRANSACTION OCCUR?
WHY DID THE TRANSACTION OCCUR?
HOW MUCH OF THE ASSET WAS EXCHANGED?
HOW MANY PRE-CONDITIONS WERE MET DURING THE TRANSACTION?
STEP 2 – GAIN CONSENSUS

PARAGRAPHS
WHAT THIS HANDOUT IS ABOUT
THIS HANDOUT WILL HELP YOU UNDERSTAND HOW PARAGRAPHS ARE FORMED, HOW TO DEVELOP STRONGER PARAGRAPHS, AND HOW TO COMPLETELY AND CLEARLY EXPRESS YOUR IDEAS.

WHAT IS A PARAGRAPH?
PARAGRAPHS ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF PAPERS. MANY STUDENTS DEFINE PARAGRAPHS IN TERMS OF LENGTH: A PARAGRAPH IS A GROUP OF AT LEAST FIVE SENTENCES, A PARAGRAPH IS HALF A PAGE LONG, ETC. IN REALITY, THOUGH, THE UNITY AND COHERENCE OF IDEAS AMONG SENTENCES IS WHAT CONSTITUTES A PARAGRAPH. A PARAGRAPH IS DEFINED AS “A GROUP OF SENTENCES OR A SINGLE SENTENCE THAT FORMS A UNIT” (LUNSFORD AND CONNORS 116). LENGTH AND APPEARANCE DO NOT DETERMINE WHETHER A SECTION IN A PAPER IS A PARAGRAPH. FOR INSTANCE, IN SOME STYLES OF WRITING, PARTICULARLY JOURNALISTIC STYLES, A PARAGRAPH CAN BE JUST ONE SENTENCE LONG. ULTIMATELY, A PARAGRAPH IS A SENTENCE OR GROUP OF SENTENCES THAT SUPPORT ONE MAIN IDEA. IN THIS HANDOUT, WE WILL REFER TO THIS AS THE “CONTROLLING IDEA,” BECAUSE IT CONTROLS WHAT HAPPENS IN THE REST OF THE PARAGRAPH.
HOW DO I DECIDE WHAT TO PUT IN A PARAGRAPH?
BEFORE YOU CAN BEGIN TO DETERMINE WHAT THE COMPOSITION OF A PARTICULAR PARAGRAPH WILL BE, YOU MUST FIRST DECIDE ON AN ARGUMENT AND A WORKING THESIS STATEMENT FOR YOUR PAPER. WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT IDEA THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO CONVEY TO YOUR READER? THE INFORMATION IN EACH PARAGRAPH MUST BE RELATED TO THAT IDEA. IN OTHER WORDS, YOUR PARAGRAPHS SHOULD REMIND YOUR READER THAT THERE IS A RECURRENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOUR THESIS AND THE INFORMATION IN EACH PARAGRAPH. A WORKING THESIS FUNCTIONS LIKE A SEED FROM WHICH YOUR PAPER, AND YOUR IDEAS, WILL GROW. THE WHOLE PROCESS IS AN ORGANIC ONE—A NATURAL PROGRESSION FROM A SEED TO A FULL-BLOWN PAPER WHERE THERE ARE DIRECT, FAMILIAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ALL OF THE IDEAS IN THE PAPER.

THE DECISION ABOUT WHAT TO PUT INTO YOUR PARAGRAPHS BEGINS WITH THE GERMINATION OF A SEED OF IDEAS; THIS “GERMINATION PROCESS” IS BETTER KNOWN AS BRAINSTORMING. THERE ARE MANY TECHNIQUES FOR BRAINSTORMING; WHICHEVER ONE YOU CHOOSE, THIS STAGE OF PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT CANNOT BE SKIPPED. BUILDING PARAGRAPHS CAN BE LIKE BUILDING A SKYSCRAPER: THERE MUST BE A WELL-PLANNED FOUNDATION THAT SUPPORTS WHAT YOU ARE BUILDING. ANY CRACKS, INCONSISTENCIES, OR OTHER CORRUPTIONS OF THE FOUNDATION CAN CAUSE YOUR WHOLE PAPER TO CRUMBLE.

SO, LET’S SUPPOSE THAT YOU HAVE DONE SOME BRAINSTORMING TO DEVELOP YOUR THESIS. WHAT ELSE SHOULD YOU KEEP IN MIND AS YOU BEGIN TO CREATE PARAGRAPHS? EVERY PARAGRAPH IN A PAPER SHOULD BE:

UNIFIED: ALL OF THE SENTENCES IN A SINGLE PARAGRAPH SHOULD BE RELATED TO A SINGLE CONTROLLING IDEA (OFTEN EXPRESSED IN THE TOPIC SENTENCE OF THE PARAGRAPH).
CLEARLY RELATED TO THE THESIS: THE SENTENCES SHOULD ALL REFER TO THE CENTRAL IDEA, OR THESIS, OF THE PAPER (ROSEN AND BEHRENS 119).
COHERENT: THE SENTENCES SHOULD BE ARRANGED IN A LOGICAL MANNER AND SHOULD FOLLOW A DEFINITE PLAN FOR DEVELOPMENT (ROSEN AND BEHRENS 119).
WELL-DEVELOPED: EVERY IDEA DISCUSSED IN THE PARAGRAPH SHOULD BE ADEQUATELY EXPLAINED AND SUPPORTED THROUGH EVIDENCE AND DETAILS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO EXPLAIN THE PARAGRAPH’S CONTROLLING IDEA (ROSEN AND BEHRENS 119).
HOW DO I ORGANIZE A PARAGRAPH?
THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS TO ORGANIZE A PARAGRAPH. THE ORGANIZATION YOU CHOOSE WILL DEPEND ON THE CONTROLLING IDEA OF THE PARAGRAPH. BELOW ARE A FEW POSSIBILITIES FOR ORGANIZATION, WITH LINKS TO BRIEF EXAMPLES:

NARRATION: TELL A STORY. GO CHRONOLOGICALLY, FROM START TO FINISH. (SEE AN EXAMPLE.)
DESCRIPTION: PROVIDE SPECIFIC DETAILS ABOUT WHAT SOMETHING LOOKS, SMELLS, TASTES, SOUNDS, OR FEELS LIKE. ORGANIZE SPATIALLY, IN ORDER OF APPEARANCE, OR BY TOPIC. (SEE AN EXAMPLE.)
PROCESS: EXPLAIN HOW SOMETHING WORKS, STEP BY STEP. PERHAPS FOLLOW A SEQUENCE—FIRST, SECOND, THIRD. (SEE AN EXAMPLE.)
CLASSIFICATION: SEPARATE INTO GROUPS OR EXPLAIN THE VARIOUS PARTS OF A TOPIC. (SEE AN EXAMPLE.)
ILLUSTRATION: GIVE EXAMPLES AND EXPLAIN HOW THOSE EXAMPLES SUPPORT YOUR POINT. (SEE AN EXAMPLE IN THE 5-STEP PROCESS BELOW.)
ILLUSTRATION PARAGRAPH: A 5-STEP EXAMPLE
FROM THE LIST ABOVE, LET’S CHOOSE “ILLUSTRATION” AS OUR RHETORICAL PURPOSE. WE’LL WALK THROUGH A 5-STEP PROCESS FOR BUILDING A PARAGRAPH THAT ILLUSTRATES A POINT IN AN ARGUMENT. FOR EACH STEP THERE IS AN EXPLANATION AND EXAMPLE. OUR EXAMPLE PARAGRAPH WILL BE ABOUT HUMAN MISCONCEPTIONS OF PIRANHAS.

PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT BEGINS WITH THE FORMULATION OF THE CONTROLLING IDEA. THIS IDEA DIRECTS THE PARAGRAPH’S DEVELOPMENT. OFTEN, THE CONTROLLING IDEA OF A PARAGRAPH WILL APPEAR IN THE FORM OF A TOPIC SENTENCE. IN SOME CASES, YOU MAY NEED MORE THAN ONE SENTENCE TO EXPRESS A PARAGRAPH’S CONTROLLING IDEA.

CONTROLLING IDEA AND TOPIC SENTENCE — DESPITE THE FACT THAT PIRANHAS ARE RELATIVELY HARMLESS, MANY PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THE PERVASIVE MYTH THAT PIRANHAS ARE DANGEROUS TO HUMANS.

STEP 2. ELABORATE ON THE CONTROLLING IDEA
PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT CONTINUES WITH AN ELABORATION ON THE CONTROLLING IDEA, PERHAPS WITH AN EXPLANATION, IMPLICATION, OR STATEMENT ABOUT SIGNIFICANCE. OUR EXAMPLE OFFERS A POSSIBLE EXPLANATION FOR THE PERVASIVENESS OF THE MYTH.

ELABORATION — THIS IMPRESSION OF PIRANHAS IS EXACERBATED BY THEIR MISCHARACTERIZATION IN POPULAR MEDIA.

STEP 3. GIVE AN EXAMPLE (OR MULTIPLE EXAMPLES)
PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT PROGRESSES WITH AN EXAMPLE (OR MORE) THAT ILLUSTRATES THE CLAIMS MADE IN THE PREVIOUS SENTENCES.

EXAMPLE — FOR EXAMPLE, THE PROMOTIONAL POSTER FOR THE 1978 HORROR FILM PIRANHA FEATURES AN OVERSIZED PIRANHA POISED TO BITE THE LEG OF AN UNSUSPECTING WOMAN.

STEP 4. EXPLAIN THE EXAMPLE(S)
THE NEXT MOVEMENT IN PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT IS AN EXPLANATION OF EACH EXAMPLE AND ITS RELEVANCE TO THE TOPIC SENTENCE. THE EXPLANATION SHOULD DEMONSTRATE THE VALUE OF THE EXAMPLE AS EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE MAJOR CLAIM, OR FOCUS, IN YOUR PARAGRAPH.

CONTINUE THE PATTERN OF GIVING EXAMPLES AND EXPLAINING THEM UNTIL ALL POINTS/EXAMPLES THAT THE WRITER DEEMS NECESSARY HAVE BEEN MADE AND EXPLAINED. NONE OF YOUR EXAMPLES SHOULD BE LEFT UNEXPLAINED. YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE EXAMPLE AND THE TOPIC SENTENCE IN THE SAME SENTENCE WHICH INTRODUCED THE EXAMPLE. MORE OFTEN, HOWEVER, YOU WILL NEED TO EXPLAIN THAT RELATIONSHIP IN A SEPARATE SENTENCE.

EXPLANATION FOR EXAMPLE — SUCH A TERRIFYING REPRESENTATION EASILY CAPTURES THE IMAGINATION AND PROMOTES UNNECESSARY FEAR.

NOTICE THAT THE EXAMPLE AND EXPLANATION STEPS OF THIS 5-STEP PROCESS (STEPS 3 AND 4) CAN BE REPEATED AS NEEDED. THE IDEA IS THAT YOU CONTINUE TO USE THIS PATTERN UNTIL YOU HAVE COMPLETELY DEVELOPED THE MAIN IDEA OF THE PARAGRAPH.

STEP 5. COMPLETE THE PARAGRAPH’S IDEA OR TRANSITION INTO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH
THE FINAL MOVEMENT IN PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT INVOLVES TYING UP THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE PARAGRAPH. AT THIS POINT, YOU CAN REMIND YOUR READER ABOUT THE RELEVANCE OF THE INFORMATION TO THE LARGER PAPER, OR YOU CAN MAKE A CONCLUDING POINT FOR THIS EXAMPLE. YOU MIGHT, HOWEVER, SIMPLY TRANSITION TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH.

SENTENCES FOR COMPLETING A PARAGRAPH — WHILE THE TROPE OF THE MAN-EATING PIRANHAS LENDS EXCITEMENT TO THE ADVENTURE STORIES, IT BEARS LITTLE RESEMBLANCE TO THE REAL-LIFE PIRANHA. BY PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO FACT THAN FICTION, HUMANS MAY FINALLY BE ABLE TO LET GO OF THIS INACCURATE BELIEF.

TROUBLESHOOTING PARAGRAPHS
PROBLEM: THE PARAGRAPH HAS NO TOPIC SENTENCE
IMAGINE EACH PARAGRAPH AS A SANDWICH. THE REAL CONTENT OF THE SANDWICH—THE MEAT OR OTHER FILLING—IS IN THE MIDDLE. IT INCLUDES ALL THE EVIDENCE YOU NEED TO MAKE THE POINT. BUT IT GETS KIND OF MESSY TO EAT A SANDWICH WITHOUT ANY BREAD. YOUR READERS DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH ALL THE EVIDENCE YOU’VE GIVEN THEM. SO, THE TOP SLICE OF BREAD (THE FIRST SENTENCE OF THE PARAGRAPH) EXPLAINS THE TOPIC (OR CONTROLLING IDEA) OF THE PARAGRAPH. AND, THE BOTTOM SLICE (THE LAST SENTENCE OF THE PARAGRAPH) TELLS THE READER HOW THE PARAGRAPH RELATES TO THE BROADER ARGUMENT. IN THE ORIGINAL AND REVISED PARAGRAPHS BELOW, NOTICE HOW A TOPIC SENTENCE EXPRESSING THE CONTROLLING IDEA TELLS THE READER THE POINT OF ALL THE EVIDENCE.

ORIGINAL PARAGRAPH

PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ FIRST INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. THEIR FEAR OF HUMANS MAKES SENSE. FAR MORE PIRANHAS ARE EATEN BY PEOPLE THAN PEOPLE ARE EATEN BY PIRANHAS. IF THE FISH ARE WELL-FED, THEY WON’T BITE HUMANS.

REVISED PARAGRAPH

ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER PIRANHAS TO BE QUITE DANGEROUS, THEY ARE, FOR THE MOST PART, ENTIRELY HARMLESS. PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ FIRST INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. THEIR FEAR OF HUMANS MAKES SENSE. FAR MORE PIRANHAS ARE EATEN BY PEOPLE THAN PEOPLE ARE EATEN BY PIRANHAS. IF THE FISH ARE WELL-FED, THEY WON’T BITE HUMANS.

ONCE YOU HAVE MASTERED THE USE OF TOPIC SENTENCES, YOU MAY DECIDE THAT THE TOPIC SENTENCE FOR A PARTICULAR PARAGRAPH REALLY SHOULDN’T BE THE FIRST SENTENCE OF THE PARAGRAPH. THIS IS FINE—THE TOPIC SENTENCE CAN ACTUALLY GO AT THE BEGINNING, MIDDLE, OR END OF A PARAGRAPH; WHAT’S IMPORTANT IS THAT IT IS IN THERE SOMEWHERE SO THAT READERS KNOW WHAT THE MAIN IDEA OF THE PARAGRAPH IS AND HOW IT RELATES BACK TO THE THESIS OF YOUR PAPER. SUPPOSE THAT WE WANTED TO START THE PIRANHA PARAGRAPH WITH A TRANSITION SENTENCE—SOMETHING THAT REMINDS THE READER OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH—RATHER THAN WITH THE TOPIC SENTENCE. LET’S SUPPOSE THAT THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH WAS ABOUT ALL KINDS OF ANIMALS THAT PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF, LIKE SHARKS, SNAKES, AND SPIDERS. OUR PARAGRAPH MIGHT LOOK LIKE THIS (THE TOPIC SENTENCE IS BOLD):

LIKE SHARKS, SNAKES, AND SPIDERS, PIRANHAS ARE WIDELY FEARED. ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER PIRANHAS TO BE QUITE DANGEROUS, THEY ARE, FOR THE MOST PART, ENTIRELY HARMLESS. PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ FIRST INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. THEIR FEAR OF HUMANS MAKES SENSE. FAR MORE PIRANHAS ARE EATEN BY PEOPLE THAN PEOPLE ARE EATEN BY PIRANHAS. IF THE FISH ARE WELL-FED, THEY WON’T BITE HUMANS.

PROBLEM: THE PARAGRAPH HAS MORE THAN ONE CONTROLLING IDEA
IF A PARAGRAPH HAS MORE THAN ONE MAIN IDEA, CONSIDER ELIMINATING SENTENCES THAT RELATE TO THE SECOND IDEA, OR SPLIT THE PARAGRAPH INTO TWO OR MORE PARAGRAPHS, EACH WITH ONLY ONE MAIN IDEA. WATCH OUR SHORT VIDEO ON REVERSE OUTLINING TO LEARN A QUICK WAY TO TEST WHETHER YOUR PARAGRAPHS ARE UNIFIED. IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH, THE FINAL TWO SENTENCES BRANCH OFF INTO A DIFFERENT TOPIC; SO, THE REVISED PARAGRAPH ELIMINATES THEM AND CONCLUDES WITH A SENTENCE THAT REMINDS THE READER OF THE PARAGRAPH’S MAIN IDEA.

ORIGINAL PARAGRAPH

ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER PIRANHAS TO BE QUITE DANGEROUS, THEY ARE, FOR THE MOST PART, ENTIRELY HARMLESS. PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ FIRST INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. THEIR FEAR OF HUMANS MAKES SENSE. FAR MORE PIRANHAS ARE EATEN BY PEOPLE THAN PEOPLE ARE EATEN BY PIRANHAS. A NUMBER OF SOUTH AMERICAN GROUPS EAT PIRANHAS. THEY FRY OR GRILL THE FISH AND THEN SERVE THEM WITH COCONUT MILK OR TUCUPI, A SAUCE MADE FROM FERMENTED MANIOC JUICES.

REVISED PARAGRAPH

ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER PIRANHAS TO BE QUITE DANGEROUS, THEY ARE, FOR THE MOST PART, ENTIRELY HARMLESS. PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ FIRST INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. THEIR FEAR OF HUMANS MAKES SENSE. FAR MORE PIRANHAS ARE EATEN BY PEOPLE THAN PEOPLE ARE EATEN BY PIRANHAS. IF THE FISH ARE WELL-FED, THEY WON’T BITE HUMANS.

PROBLEM: TRANSITIONS ARE NEEDED WITHIN THE PARAGRAPH
YOU ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH THE IDEA THAT TRANSITIONS MAY BE NEEDED BETWEEN PARAGRAPHS OR SECTIONS IN A PAPER (SEE OUR HANDOUT ON TRANSITIONS). SOMETIMES THEY ARE ALSO HELPFUL WITHIN THE BODY OF A SINGLE PARAGRAPH. WITHIN A PARAGRAPH, TRANSITIONS ARE OFTEN SINGLE WORDS OR SHORT PHRASES THAT HELP TO ESTABLISH RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN IDEAS AND TO CREATE A LOGICAL PROGRESSION OF THOSE IDEAS IN A PARAGRAPH. THIS IS ESPECIALLY LIKELY TO BE TRUE WITHIN PARAGRAPHS THAT DISCUSS MULTIPLE EXAMPLES. LET’S TAKE A LOOK AT A VERSION OF OUR PIRANHA PARAGRAPH THAT USES TRANSITIONS TO ORIENT THE READER:

ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER PIRANHAS TO BE QUITE DANGEROUS, THEY ARE, EXCEPT IN TWO MAIN SITUATIONS, ENTIRELY HARMLESS. PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. BUT THERE ARE TWO SITUATIONS IN WHICH A PIRANHA BITE IS LIKELY. THE FIRST IS WHEN A FRIGHTENED PIRANHA IS LIFTED OUT OF THE WATER—FOR EXAMPLE, IF IT HAS BEEN CAUGHT IN A FISHING NET. THE SECOND IS WHEN THE WATER LEVEL IN POOLS WHERE PIRANHAS ARE LIVING FALLS TOO LOW. A LARGE NUMBER OF FISH MAY BE TRAPPED IN A SINGLE POOL, AND IF THEY ARE HUNGRY, THEY MAY ATTACK ANYTHING THAT ENTERS THE WATER.

IN THIS EXAMPLE, YOU CAN SEE HOW THE PHRASES “THE FIRST” AND “THE SECOND” HELP THE READER FOLLOW THE ORGANIZATION OF THE IDEAS IN THE PARAGRAPH.

BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY IS AN ADVANCED DATABASE MECHANISM THAT ALLOWS TRANSPARENT INFORMATION SHARING WITHIN A BUSINESS 
NETWORK. A BLOCKCHAIN DATABASE STORES DATA IN BLOCKS THAT ARE LINKED TOGETHER IN A CHAIN. THE DATA IS CHRONOLOGICALLY 
CONSISTENT BECAUSE YOU CANNOT DELETE OR MODIFY THE CHAIN WITHOUT CONSENSUS FROM THE NETWORK. AS A RESULT, YOU CAN USE
 BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE AN UNALTERABLE OR IMMUTABLE LEDGER FOR TRACKING ORDERS, PAYMENTS, ACCOUNTS, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS. THE SYSTEM HAS BUILT-IN MECHANISMS THAT PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTION ENTRIES AND CREATE CONSISTENCY IN THE SHARED VIEW OF THESE TRANSACTIONS.
TRADITIONAL DATABASE TECHNOLOGIES PRESENT SEVERAL CHALLENGES FOR RECORDING FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS. FOR INSTANCE, CONSIDER THE SALE OF A PROPERTY. ONCE THE MONEY IS EXCHANGED, OWNERSHIP OF THE PROPERTY IS TRANSFERRED TO THE BUYER. INDIVIDUALLY, BOTH THE BUYER AND THE SELLER CAN RECORD THE MONETARY TRANSACTIONS, BUT NEITHER SOURCE CAN BE TRUSTED. THE SELLER CAN EASILY CLAIM THEY HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE MONEY EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE, AND THE BUYER CAN EQUALLY ARGUE THAT THEY HAVE PAID THE MONEY EVEN IF THEY HAVEN’T.

TO AVOID POTENTIAL LEGAL ISSUES, A TRUSTED THIRD PARTY HAS TO SUPERVISE AND VALIDATE TRANSACTIONS. THE PRESENCE OF THIS CENTRAL AUTHORITY NOT ONLY COMPLICATES THE TRANSACTION BUT ALSO CREATES A SINGLE POINT OF VULNERABILITY. IF THE CENTRAL DATABASE WAS COMPROMISED, BOTH PARTIES COULD SUFFER.

BLOCKCHAIN MITIGATES SUCH ISSUES BY CREATING A DECENTRALIZED, TAMPER-PROOF SYSTEM TO RECORD TRANSACTIONS. IN THE PROPERTY TRANSACTION SCENARIO, BLOCKCHAIN CREATES ONE LEDGER EACH FOR THE BUYER AND THE SELLER. ALL TRANSACTIONS MUST BE APPROVED BY BOTH PARTIES AND ARE AUTOMATICALLY UPDATED IN BOTH OF THEIR LEDGERS IN REAL TIME. ANY CORRUPTION IN HISTORICAL TRANSACTIONS WILL CORRUPT THE ENTIRE LEDGER. THESE PROPERTIES OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY HAVE LED TO ITS USE IN VARIOUS SECTORS, INCLUDING THE CREATION OF DIGITAL CURRENCY LIKE BITCOIN.
HOW DO DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES USE BLOCKCHAIN?
BLOCKCHAIN IS AN EMERGING TECHNOLOGY THAT IS BEING ADOPTED IN INNOVATIVE MANNER BY VARIOUS INDUSTRIES. WE DESCRIBE SOME USE CASES IN DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES IN THE FOLLOWING SUBSECTIONS:


ENERGY
ENERGY COMPANIES USE BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE PEER-TO-PEER ENERGY TRADING PLATFORMS AND STREAMLINE ACCESS TO RENEWABLE ENERGY. FOR EXAMPLE, CONSIDER THESE USES:

BLOCKCHAIN-BASED ENERGY COMPANIES HAVE CREATED A TRADING PLATFORM FOR THE SALE OF ELECTRICITY BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS. HOMEOWNERS WITH SOLAR PANELS USE THIS PLATFORM TO SELL THEIR EXCESS SOLAR ENERGY TO NEIGHBORS. THE PROCESS IS LARGELY AUTOMATED: SMART METERS CREATE TRANSACTIONS, AND BLOCKCHAIN RECORDS THEM.
WITH BLOCKCHAIN-BASED CROWD FUNDING INITIATIVES, USERS CAN SPONSOR AND OWN SOLAR PANELS IN COMMUNITIES THAT LACK ENERGY ACCESS. SPONSORS MIGHT ALSO RECEIVE RENT FOR THESE COMMUNITIES ONCE THE SOLAR PANELS ARE CONSTRUCTED.
FINANCE
TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL SYSTEMS, LIKE BANKS AND STOCK EXCHANGES, USE BLOCKCHAIN SERVICES TO MANAGE ONLINE PAYMENTS, ACCOUNTS, AND MARKET TRADING. FOR EXAMPLE, SINGAPORE EXCHANGE LIMITED, AN INVESTMENT HOLDING COMPANY THAT PROVIDES FINANCIAL TRADING SERVICES THROUGHOUT ASIA, USES BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY TO BUILD A MORE EFFICIENT INTERBANK PAYMENT ACCOUNT. BY ADOPTING BLOCKCHAIN, THEY SOLVED SEVERAL CHALLENGES, INCLUDING BATCH PROCESSING AND MANUAL RECONCILIATION OF SEVERAL THOUSAND FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS.

MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT
COMPANIES IN MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT USE BLOCKCHAIN SYSTEMS TO MANAGE COPYRIGHT DATA. COPYRIGHT VERIFICATION IS CRITICAL FOR THE FAIR COMPENSATION OF ARTISTS. IT TAKES MULTIPLE TRANSACTIONS TO RECORD THE SALE OR TRANSFER OF COPYRIGHT CONTENT. SONY MUSIC ENTERTAINMENT JAPAN USES BLOCKCHAIN SERVICES TO MAKE DIGITAL RIGHTS MANAGEMENT MORE EFFICIENT. THEY HAVE SUCCESSFULLY USED BLOCKCHAIN STRATEGY TO IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY AND REDUCE COSTS IN COPYRIGHT PROCESSING.

RETAIL
RETAIL COMPANIES USE BLOCKCHAIN TO TRACK THE MOVEMENT OF GOODS BETWEEN SUPPLIERS AND BUYERS. FOR EXAMPLE, AMAZON RETAIL HAS FILED A PATENT FOR A DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM THAT WILL USE BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY TO VERIFY THAT ALL GOODS SOLD ON THE PLATFORM ARE AUTHENTIC. AMAZON SELLERS CAN MAP THEIR GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS BY ALLOWING PARTICIPANTS SUCH AS MANUFACTURERS, COURIERS, DISTRIBUTORS, END USERS, AND SECONDARY USERS TO ADD EVENTS TO THE LEDGER AFTER REGISTERING WITH A CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY. 

WHAT ARE THE FEATURES OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY?
BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY HAS THE FOLLOWING MAIN FEATURES:

DECENTRALIZATION
DECENTRALIZATION IN BLOCKCHAIN REFERS TO TRANSFERRING CONTROL AND DECISION MAKING FROM A CENTRALIZED ENTITY (INDIVIDUAL, ORGANIZATION, OR GROUP) TO A DISTRIBUTED NETWORK. DECENTRALIZED BLOCKCHAIN NETWORKS USE TRANSPARENCY TO REDUCE THE NEED FOR TRUST AMONG PARTICIPANTS. THESE NETWORKS ALSO DETER PARTICIPANTS FROM EXERTING AUTHORITY OR CONTROL OVER ONE ANOTHER IN WAYS THAT DEGRADE THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE NETWORK.

IMMUTABILITY
IMMUTABILITY MEANS SOMETHING CANNOT BE CHANGED OR ALTERED. NO PARTICIPANT CAN TAMPER WITH A TRANSACTION ONCE SOMEONE HAS RECORDED IT TO THE SHARED LEDGER. IF A TRANSACTION RECORD INCLUDES AN ERROR, YOU MUST ADD A NEW TRANSACTION TO REVERSE THE MISTAKE, AND BOTH TRANSACTIONS ARE VISIBLE TO THE NETWORK.

CONSENSUS
A BLOCKCHAIN SYSTEM ESTABLISHES RULES ABOUT PARTICIPANT CONSENT FOR RECORDING TRANSACTIONS. YOU CAN RECORD NEW TRANSACTIONS ONLY WHEN THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE NETWORK GIVE THEIR CONSENT.

WHAT ARE THE KEY COMPONENTS OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY?
BLOCKCHAIN ARCHITECTURE HAS THE FOLLOWING MAIN COMPONENTS:

A DISTRIBUTED LEDGER

A DISTRIBUTED LEDGER IS THE SHARED DATABASE IN THE BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK THAT STORES THE TRANSACTIONS, SUCH AS A SHARED FILE THAT EVERYONE IN THE TEAM CAN EDIT. IN MOST SHARED TEXT EDITORS, ANYONE WITH EDITING RIGHTS CAN DELETE THE ENTIRE FILE. HOWEVER, DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGIES HAVE STRICT RULES ABOUT WHO CAN EDIT AND HOW TO EDIT. YOU CANNOT DELETE ENTRIES ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN RECORDED.

SMART CONTRACTS
COMPANIES USE SMART CONTRACTS TO SELF-MANAGE BUSINESS CONTRACTS WITHOUT THE NEED FOR AN ASSISTING THIRD PARTY. THEY ARE PROGRAMS STORED ON THE BLOCKCHAIN SYSTEM THAT RUN AUTOMATICALLY WHEN PREDETERMINED CONDITIONS ARE MET. THEY RUN IF-THEN CHECKS SO THAT TRANSACTIONS CAN BE COMPLETED CONFIDENTLY. FOR EXAMPLE, A LOGISTICS COMPANY CAN HAVE A SMART CONTRACT THAT AUTOMATICALLY MAKES PAYMENT ONCE GOODS HAVE ARRIVED AT THE PORT.

PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY
PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY IS A SECURITY FEATURE TO UNIQUELY IDENTIFY PARTICIPANTS IN THE BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK. THIS MECHANISM GENERATES TWO SETS OF KEYS FOR NETWORK MEMBERS. ONE KEY IS A PUBLIC KEY THAT IS COMMON TO EVERYONE IN THE NETWORK. THE OTHER IS A PRIVATE KEY THAT IS UNIQUE TO EVERY MEMBER. THE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC KEYS WORK TOGETHER TO UNLOCK THE DATA IN THE LEDGER. 

FOR EXAMPLE, JOHN AND JILL ARE TWO MEMBERS OF THE NETWORK. JOHN RECORDS A TRANSACTION THAT IS ENCRYPTED WITH HIS PRIVATE KEY. JILL CAN DECRYPT IT WITH HER PUBLIC KEY. THIS WAY, JILL IS CONFIDENT THAT JOHN MADE THE TRANSACTION. JILL'S PUBLIC KEY WOULDN'T HAVE WORKED IF JOHN'S PRIVATE KEY HAD BEEN TAMPERED WITH.

HOW DOES BLOCKCHAIN WORK?
WHILE UNDERLYING BLOCKCHAIN MECHANISMS ARE COMPLEX, WE GIVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW IN THE FOLLOWING STEPS. BLOCKCHAIN SOFTWARE CAN AUTOMATE MOST OF THESE STEPS:

STEP 1 – RECORD THE TRANSACTION
A BLOCKCHAIN TRANSACTION SHOWS THE MOVEMENT OF PHYSICAL OR DIGITAL ASSETS FROM ONE PARTY TO ANOTHER IN THE BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK. IT IS RECORDED AS A DATA BLOCK AND CAN INCLUDE DETAILS LIKE THESE:

WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THE TRANSACTION?
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE TRANSACTION?
WHEN DID THE TRANSACTION OCCUR?
WHERE DID THE TRANSACTION OCCUR?
WHY DID THE TRANSACTION OCCUR?
HOW MUCH OF THE ASSET WAS EXCHANGED?
HOW MANY PRE-CONDITIONS WERE MET DURING THE TRANSACTION?
STEP 2 – GAIN CONSENSUS

PARAGRAPHS
WHAT THIS HANDOUT IS ABOUT
THIS HANDOUT WILL HELP YOU UNDERSTAND HOW PARAGRAPHS ARE FORMED, HOW TO DEVELOP STRONGER PARAGRAPHS, AND HOW TO COMPLETELY AND CLEARLY EXPRESS YOUR IDEAS.

WHAT IS A PARAGRAPH?
PARAGRAPHS ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF PAPERS. MANY STUDENTS DEFINE PARAGRAPHS IN TERMS OF LENGTH: A PARAGRAPH IS A GROUP OF AT LEAST FIVE SENTENCES, A PARAGRAPH IS HALF A PAGE LONG, ETC. IN REALITY, THOUGH, THE UNITY AND COHERENCE OF IDEAS AMONG SENTENCES IS WHAT CONSTITUTES A PARAGRAPH. A PARAGRAPH IS DEFINED AS “A GROUP OF SENTENCES OR A SINGLE SENTENCE THAT FORMS A UNIT” (LUNSFORD AND CONNORS 116). LENGTH AND APPEARANCE DO NOT DETERMINE WHETHER A SECTION IN A PAPER IS A PARAGRAPH. FOR INSTANCE, IN SOME STYLES OF WRITING, PARTICULARLY JOURNALISTIC STYLES, A PARAGRAPH CAN BE JUST ONE SENTENCE LONG. ULTIMATELY, A PARAGRAPH IS A SENTENCE OR GROUP OF SENTENCES THAT SUPPORT ONE MAIN IDEA. IN THIS HANDOUT, WE WILL REFER TO THIS AS THE “CONTROLLING IDEA,” BECAUSE IT CONTROLS WHAT HAPPENS IN THE REST OF THE PARAGRAPH.
HOW DO I DECIDE WHAT TO PUT IN A PARAGRAPH?
BEFORE YOU CAN BEGIN TO DETERMINE WHAT THE COMPOSITION OF A PARTICULAR PARAGRAPH WILL BE, YOU MUST FIRST DECIDE ON AN ARGUMENT AND A WORKING THESIS STATEMENT FOR YOUR PAPER. WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT IDEA THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO CONVEY TO YOUR READER? THE INFORMATION IN EACH PARAGRAPH MUST BE RELATED TO THAT IDEA. IN OTHER WORDS, YOUR PARAGRAPHS SHOULD REMIND YOUR READER THAT THERE IS A RECURRENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOUR THESIS AND THE INFORMATION IN EACH PARAGRAPH. A WORKING THESIS FUNCTIONS LIKE A SEED FROM WHICH YOUR PAPER, AND YOUR IDEAS, WILL GROW. THE WHOLE PROCESS IS AN ORGANIC ONE—A NATURAL PROGRESSION FROM A SEED TO A FULL-BLOWN PAPER WHERE THERE ARE DIRECT, FAMILIAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ALL OF THE IDEAS IN THE PAPER.

THE DECISION ABOUT WHAT TO PUT INTO YOUR PARAGRAPHS BEGINS WITH THE GERMINATION OF A SEED OF IDEAS; THIS “GERMINATION PROCESS” IS BETTER KNOWN AS BRAINSTORMING. THERE ARE MANY TECHNIQUES FOR BRAINSTORMING; WHICHEVER ONE YOU CHOOSE, THIS STAGE OF PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT CANNOT BE SKIPPED. BUILDING PARAGRAPHS CAN BE LIKE BUILDING A SKYSCRAPER: THERE MUST BE A WELL-PLANNED FOUNDATION THAT SUPPORTS WHAT YOU ARE BUILDING. ANY CRACKS, INCONSISTENCIES, OR OTHER CORRUPTIONS OF THE FOUNDATION CAN CAUSE YOUR WHOLE PAPER TO CRUMBLE.

SO, LET’S SUPPOSE THAT YOU HAVE DONE SOME BRAINSTORMING TO DEVELOP YOUR THESIS. WHAT ELSE SHOULD YOU KEEP IN MIND AS YOU BEGIN TO CREATE PARAGRAPHS? EVERY PARAGRAPH IN A PAPER SHOULD BE:

UNIFIED: ALL OF THE SENTENCES IN A SINGLE PARAGRAPH SHOULD BE RELATED TO A SINGLE CONTROLLING IDEA (OFTEN EXPRESSED IN THE TOPIC SENTENCE OF THE PARAGRAPH).
CLEARLY RELATED TO THE THESIS: THE SENTENCES SHOULD ALL REFER TO THE CENTRAL IDEA, OR THESIS, OF THE PAPER (ROSEN AND BEHRENS 119).
COHERENT: THE SENTENCES SHOULD BE ARRANGED IN A LOGICAL MANNER AND SHOULD FOLLOW A DEFINITE PLAN FOR DEVELOPMENT (ROSEN AND BEHRENS 119).
WELL-DEVELOPED: EVERY IDEA DISCUSSED IN THE PARAGRAPH SHOULD BE ADEQUATELY EXPLAINED AND SUPPORTED THROUGH EVIDENCE AND DETAILS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO EXPLAIN THE PARAGRAPH’S CONTROLLING IDEA (ROSEN AND BEHRENS 119).
HOW DO I ORGANIZE A PARAGRAPH?
THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS TO ORGANIZE A PARAGRAPH. THE ORGANIZATION YOU CHOOSE WILL DEPEND ON THE CONTROLLING IDEA OF THE PARAGRAPH. BELOW ARE A FEW POSSIBILITIES FOR ORGANIZATION, WITH LINKS TO BRIEF EXAMPLES:

NARRATION: TELL A STORY. GO CHRONOLOGICALLY, FROM START TO FINISH. (SEE AN EXAMPLE.)
DESCRIPTION: PROVIDE SPECIFIC DETAILS ABOUT WHAT SOMETHING LOOKS, SMELLS, TASTES, SOUNDS, OR FEELS LIKE. ORGANIZE SPATIALLY, IN ORDER OF APPEARANCE, OR BY TOPIC. (SEE AN EXAMPLE.)
PROCESS: EXPLAIN HOW SOMETHING WORKS, STEP BY STEP. PERHAPS FOLLOW A SEQUENCE—FIRST, SECOND, THIRD. (SEE AN EXAMPLE.)
CLASSIFICATION: SEPARATE INTO GROUPS OR EXPLAIN THE VARIOUS PARTS OF A TOPIC. (SEE AN EXAMPLE.)
ILLUSTRATION: GIVE EXAMPLES AND EXPLAIN HOW THOSE EXAMPLES SUPPORT YOUR POINT. (SEE AN EXAMPLE IN THE 5-STEP PROCESS BELOW.)
ILLUSTRATION PARAGRAPH: A 5-STEP EXAMPLE
FROM THE LIST ABOVE, LET’S CHOOSE “ILLUSTRATION” AS OUR RHETORICAL PURPOSE. WE’LL WALK THROUGH A 5-STEP PROCESS FOR BUILDING A PARAGRAPH THAT ILLUSTRATES A POINT IN AN ARGUMENT. FOR EACH STEP THERE IS AN EXPLANATION AND EXAMPLE. OUR EXAMPLE PARAGRAPH WILL BE ABOUT HUMAN MISCONCEPTIONS OF PIRANHAS.

STEP 1. DECIDE ON A CONTROLLING IDEA AND CREATE A TOPIC SENTENCE
PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT BEGINS WITH THE FORMULATION OF THE CONTROLLING IDEA. THIS IDEA DIRECTS THE PARAGRAPH’S DEVELOPMENT. OFTEN, THE CONTROLLING IDEA OF A PARAGRAPH WILL APPEAR IN THE FORM OF A TOPIC SENTENCE. IN SOME CASES, YOU MAY NEED MORE THAN ONE SENTENCE TO EXPRESS A PARAGRAPH’S CONTROLLING IDEA.

CONTROLLING IDEA AND TOPIC SENTENCE — DESPITE THE FACT THAT PIRANHAS ARE RELATIVELY HARMLESS, MANY PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THE PERVASIVE MYTH THAT PIRANHAS ARE DANGEROUS TO HUMANS.

STEP 2. ELABORATE ON THE CONTROLLING IDEA
PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT CONTINUES WITH AN ELABORATION ON THE CONTROLLING IDEA, PERHAPS WITH AN EXPLANATION, IMPLICATION, OR STATEMENT ABOUT SIGNIFICANCE. OUR EXAMPLE OFFERS A POSSIBLE EXPLANATION FOR THE PERVASIVENESS OF THE MYTH.

ELABORATION — THIS IMPRESSION OF PIRANHAS IS EXACERBATED BY THEIR MISCHARACTERIZATION IN POPULAR MEDIA.

STEP 3. GIVE AN EXAMPLE (OR MULTIPLE EXAMPLES)
PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT PROGRESSES WITH AN EXAMPLE (OR MORE) THAT ILLUSTRATES THE CLAIMS MADE IN THE PREVIOUS SENTENCES.

EXAMPLE — FOR EXAMPLE, THE PROMOTIONAL POSTER FOR THE 1978 HORROR FILM PIRANHA FEATURES AN OVERSIZED PIRANHA POISED TO BITE THE LEG OF AN UNSUSPECTING WOMAN.

STEP 4. EXPLAIN THE EXAMPLE(S)
THE NEXT MOVEMENT IN PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT IS AN EXPLANATION OF EACH EXAMPLE AND ITS RELEVANCE TO THE TOPIC SENTENCE. THE EXPLANATION SHOULD DEMONSTRATE THE VALUE OF THE EXAMPLE AS EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE MAJOR CLAIM, OR FOCUS, IN YOUR PARAGRAPH.

CONTINUE THE PATTERN OF GIVING EXAMPLES AND EXPLAINING THEM UNTIL ALL POINTS/EXAMPLES THAT THE WRITER DEEMS NECESSARY HAVE BEEN MADE AND EXPLAINED. NONE OF YOUR EXAMPLES SHOULD BE LEFT UNEXPLAINED. YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE EXAMPLE AND THE TOPIC SENTENCE IN THE SAME SENTENCE WHICH INTRODUCED THE EXAMPLE. MORE OFTEN, HOWEVER, YOU WILL NEED TO EXPLAIN THAT RELATIONSHIP IN A SEPARATE SENTENCE.

EXPLANATION FOR EXAMPLE — SUCH A TERRIFYING REPRESENTATION EASILY CAPTURES THE IMAGINATION AND PROMOTES UNNECESSARY FEAR.

NOTICE THAT THE EXAMPLE AND EXPLANATION STEPS OF THIS 5-STEP PROCESS (STEPS 3 AND 4) CAN BE REPEATED AS NEEDED. THE IDEA IS THAT YOU CONTINUE TO USE THIS PATTERN UNTIL YOU HAVE COMPLETELY DEVELOPED THE MAIN IDEA OF THE PARAGRAPH.

STEP 5. COMPLETE THE PARAGRAPH’S IDEA OR TRANSITION INTO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH
THE FINAL MOVEMENT IN PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT INVOLVES TYING UP THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE PARAGRAPH. AT THIS POINT, YOU CAN REMIND YOUR READER ABOUT THE RELEVANCE OF THE INFORMATION TO THE LARGER PAPER, OR YOU CAN MAKE A CONCLUDING POINT FOR THIS EXAMPLE. YOU MIGHT, HOWEVER, SIMPLY TRANSITION TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH.

SENTENCES FOR COMPLETING A PARAGRAPH — WHILE THE TROPE OF THE MAN-EATING PIRANHAS LENDS EXCITEMENT TO THE ADVENTURE STORIES, IT BEARS LITTLE RESEMBLANCE TO THE REAL-LIFE PIRANHA. BY PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO FACT THAN FICTION, HUMANS MAY FINALLY BE ABLE TO LET GO OF THIS INACCURATE BELIEF.

FINISHED PARAGRAPH
DESPITE THE FACT THAT PIRANHAS ARE RELATIVELY HARMLESS, MANY PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THE PERVASIVE MYTH THAT PIRANHAS ARE DANGEROUS TO HUMANS. THIS IMPRESSION OF PIRANHAS IS EXACERBATED BY THEIR MISCHARACTERIZATION IN POPULAR MEDIA. FOR EXAMPLE, THE PROMOTIONAL POSTER FOR THE 1978 HORROR FILM PIRANHA FEATURES AN OVERSIZED PIRANHA POISED TO BITE THE LEG OF AN UNSUSPECTING WOMAN. SUCH A TERRIFYING REPRESENTATION EASILY CAPTURES THE IMAGINATION AND PROMOTES UNNECESSARY FEAR. WHILE THE TROPE OF THE MAN-EATING PIRANHAS LENDS EXCITEMENT TO THE ADVENTURE STORIES, IT BEARS LITTLE RESEMBLANCE TO THE REAL-LIFE PIRANHA. BY PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO FACT THAN FICTION, HUMANS MAY FINALLY BE ABLE TO LET GO OF THIS INACCURATE BELIEF.

TROUBLESHOOTING PARAGRAPHS
PROBLEM: THE PARAGRAPH HAS NO TOPIC SENTENCE
IMAGINE EACH PARAGRAPH AS A SANDWICH. THE REAL CONTENT OF THE SANDWICH—THE MEAT OR OTHER FILLING—IS IN THE MIDDLE. IT INCLUDES ALL THE EVIDENCE YOU NEED TO MAKE THE POINT. BUT IT GETS KIND OF MESSY TO EAT A SANDWICH WITHOUT ANY BREAD. YOUR READERS DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH ALL THE EVIDENCE YOU’VE GIVEN THEM. SO, THE TOP SLICE OF BREAD (THE FIRST SENTENCE OF THE PARAGRAPH) EXPLAINS THE TOPIC (OR CONTROLLING IDEA) OF THE PARAGRAPH. AND, THE BOTTOM SLICE (THE LAST SENTENCE OF THE PARAGRAPH) TELLS THE READER HOW THE PARAGRAPH RELATES TO THE BROADER ARGUMENT. IN THE ORIGINAL AND REVISED PARAGRAPHS BELOW, NOTICE HOW A TOPIC SENTENCE EXPRESSING THE CONTROLLING IDEA TELLS THE READER THE POINT OF ALL THE EVIDENCE.

ORIGINAL PARAGRAPH

PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ FIRST INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. THEIR FEAR OF HUMANS MAKES SENSE. FAR MORE PIRANHAS ARE EATEN BY PEOPLE THAN PEOPLE ARE EATEN BY PIRANHAS. IF THE FISH ARE WELL-FED, THEY WON’T BITE HUMANS.

REVISED PARAGRAPH

ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER PIRANHAS TO BE QUITE DANGEROUS, THEY ARE, FOR THE MOST PART, ENTIRELY HARMLESS. PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ FIRST INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. THEIR FEAR OF HUMANS MAKES SENSE. FAR MORE PIRANHAS ARE EATEN BY PEOPLE THAN PEOPLE ARE EATEN BY PIRANHAS. IF THE FISH ARE WELL-FED, THEY WON’T BITE HUMANS.

ONCE YOU HAVE MASTERED THE USE OF TOPIC SENTENCES, YOU MAY DECIDE THAT THE TOPIC SENTENCE FOR A PARTICULAR PARAGRAPH REALLY SHOULDN’T BE THE FIRST SENTENCE OF THE PARAGRAPH. THIS IS FINE—THE TOPIC SENTENCE CAN ACTUALLY GO AT THE BEGINNING, MIDDLE, OR END OF A PARAGRAPH; WHAT’S IMPORTANT IS THAT IT IS IN THERE SOMEWHERE SO THAT READERS KNOW WHAT THE MAIN IDEA OF THE PARAGRAPH IS AND HOW IT RELATES BACK TO THE THESIS OF YOUR PAPER. SUPPOSE THAT WE WANTED TO START THE PIRANHA PARAGRAPH WITH A TRANSITION SENTENCE—SOMETHING THAT REMINDS THE READER OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH—RATHER THAN WITH THE TOPIC SENTENCE. LET’S SUPPOSE THAT THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH WAS ABOUT ALL KINDS OF ANIMALS THAT PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF, LIKE SHARKS, SNAKES, AND SPIDERS. OUR PARAGRAPH MIGHT LOOK LIKE THIS (THE TOPIC SENTENCE IS BOLD):

LIKE SHARKS, SNAKES, AND SPIDERS, PIRANHAS ARE WIDELY FEARED. ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER PIRANHAS TO BE QUITE DANGEROUS, THEY ARE, FOR THE MOST PART, ENTIRELY HARMLESS. PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ FIRST INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. THEIR FEAR OF HUMANS MAKES SENSE. FAR MORE PIRANHAS ARE EATEN BY PEOPLE THAN PEOPLE ARE EATEN BY PIRANHAS. IF THE FISH ARE WELL-FED, THEY WON’T BITE HUMANS.

PROBLEM: THE PARAGRAPH HAS MORE THAN ONE CONTROLLING IDEA
IF A PARAGRAPH HAS MORE THAN ONE MAIN IDEA, CONSIDER ELIMINATING SENTENCES THAT RELATE TO THE SECOND IDEA, OR SPLIT THE PARAGRAPH INTO TWO OR MORE PARAGRAPHS, EACH WITH ONLY ONE MAIN IDEA. WATCH OUR SHORT VIDEO ON REVERSE OUTLINING TO LEARN A QUICK WAY TO TEST WHETHER YOUR PARAGRAPHS ARE UNIFIED. IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH, THE FINAL TWO SENTENCES BRANCH OFF INTO A DIFFERENT TOPIC; SO, THE REVISED PARAGRAPH ELIMINATES THEM AND CONCLUDES WITH A SENTENCE THAT REMINDS THE READER OF THE PARAGRAPH’S MAIN IDEA.

A NUMBER OF SOUTH AMERICAN GROUPS EAT PIRANHAS. THEY FRY OR GRILL THE FISH AND THEN SERVE THEM WITH COCONUT MILK OR TUCUPI, A SAUCE MADE FROM FERMENTED MANIOC JUICES.

IF THE FISH ARE WELL-FED, THEY WON’T BITE HUMANS.

PROBLEM: TRANSITIONS ARE NEEDED WITHIN THE PARAGRAPH
YOU ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH THE IDEA THAT TRANSITIONS MAY BE NEEDED BETWEEN PARAGRAPHS OR SECTIONS IN A PAPER (SEE OUR HANDOUT ON TRANSITIONS). SOMETIMES THEY ARE ALSO HELPFUL WITHIN THE BODY OF A SINGLE PARAGRAPH. WITHIN A PARAGRAPH, TRANSITIONS ARE OFTEN SINGLE WORDS OR SHORT PHRASES THAT HELP TO ESTABLISH RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN IDEAS AND TO CREATE A LOGICAL PROGRESSION OF THOSE IDEAS IN A PARAGRAPH. THIS IS ESPECIALLY LIKELY TO BE TRUE WITHIN PARAGRAPHS THAT DISCUSS MULTIPLE EXAMPLES. LET’S TAKE A LOOK AT A VERSION OF OUR PIRANHA PARAGRAPH THAT USES TRANSITIONS TO ORIENT THE READER:

ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER PIRANHAS TO BE QUITE DANGEROUS, THEY ARE, EXCEPT IN TWO MAIN SITUATIONS, ENTIRELY HARMLESS. PIRANHAS RARELY FEED ON LARGE ANIMALS; THEY EAT SMALLER FISH AND AQUATIC PLANTS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HUMANS, PIRANHAS’ INSTINCT IS TO FLEE, NOT ATTACK. BUT THERE ARE TWO SITUATIONS IN WHICH A PIRANHA BITE IS LIKELY. THE FIRST IS WHEN A FRIGHTENED PIRANHA IS LIFTED OUT OF THE WATER—FOR EXAMPLE, IF IT HAS BEEN CAUGHT IN A FISHING NET. THE SECOND IS WHEN THE WATER LEVEL IN POOLS WHERE PIRANHAS ARE LIVING FALLS TOO LOW. A LARGE NUMBER OF FISH MAY BE TRAPPED IN A SINGLE POOL, AND IF THEY ARE HUNGRY, THEY MAY ATTACK ANYTHING THAT ENTERS THE WATER.

IN THIS EXAMPLE, YOU CAN SEE HOW THE PHRASES “THE FIRST” AND “THE SECOND” HELP THE READER FOLLOW THE ORGANIZATION OF THE IDEAS IN THE PARAGRAPH.
